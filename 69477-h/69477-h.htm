  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER I<br> <span class='large'>JOE SOLVES A PUZZLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“How did he do it? That’s what I’d like to
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So would I. It sure was a queer trick all right—and
it looked so easy, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ve tried to guess, but I can’t. The more
I think of it the more I believe that the professor
really is a magician, in a certain way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pooh! It couldn’t be anything like that! It
was just a trick, like all the others he did. But I’d
like to know how to do it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Four boys sat under the shade of a big willow
tree in a grassy meadow on the bank of a stream.
They were earnestly discussing something, the import
of which may be gathered from their talk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I tried to do the trick after I got home last
night,” confessed Harry Martin.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>“You didn’t do it, did you?” asked Charlie Ford,
rumpling up his red hair. Charlie was not at all
ashamed of his red hair. His sister Mazie called
it “auburn,” but Charlie himself stuck to plain
“red.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do it? I should say not!” cried Harry. “I
didn’t come within a mile of it, and our folks just
laughed at me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And yet how easy Professor Rosello did it,”
observed Henry Blake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and he didn’t have any machinery or truck
on the stage to do it with, as he had for his other
tricks,” remarked Tom Simpson. “All he had was
a plain slate, same as the little kids use in our
school.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It must have been a trick slate,” said Harry.
“That’s the only way I can account for the figures
getting on it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, there wasn’t any trick about the slate,”
declared Charlie Ford. “I was sitting right up
front, and he passed the slate to me first, to look
at. There wasn’t a sign of a number on it when I
had it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And you handed it right over to Mr. Burton to
hold, didn’t you?” asked Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; and Mr. Burton held it until the figures
came out on it—under the handkerchief, of course.
It sure was a good trick.” Charlie shook his head
in wonderment.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>“I’d like to know how it was done,” said Henry
Blake. “But I don’t s’pose he’d tell us if we asked
him. He’s in town yet. I saw him around the
hotel when I came past a little while ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t very likely he’d tell us how he did it,”
said Harry. “That’s the way he makes his living—by
doing magical tricks—and it isn’t to be supposed
that he’d give away his secrets. But all the
same——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, fellows! What’s up now?” asked a new
voice. “Talking secrets that you don’t want me to
hear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The four boys, gathered under the willow tree,
looked up quickly. Looks of welcome accompanied
by smiles greeted the newcomer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Joe!” shouted Charlie Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, you’re looking good!” added Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m feeling good,” was the response. “What’s
up?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we’re just talking about the show last
night. You were there, weren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I saw the great Professor Alonzo Rosello
give his world-mystifying exhibition of black and
allied arts,” and Joe smiled as he quoted from the
circulars that had been scattered broadcast over the
town of Bedford, advertising the exhibition given in
the Opera House the previous evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did you think of him?” asked Henry
Blake.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>“Why, he was pretty fair in some things,” said
Joe, slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pretty fair? Why, say! he was great!” cried
Tom Simpson. “I’d like to see you do even the
simplest trick that he did!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Perhaps I can,” replied Joe, quietly.</p>

<p class='c007'>His chums looked curiously at him. And, for
the moment, we can do no better than to observe
this boy, who had sunk down in an easy position
on the grass. A moment’s study of him now will
help greatly in understanding the nature of a youth
destined to have many curious and thrilling adventures.
And he was a lad well adapted by nature
for a life of daring excitement.</p>

<p class='c007'>Briefly, Joe Strong was a remarkable boy. From
the time of his early infancy he had never known
what it was to be ill or ailing. Even the simplest
childish diseases seemed to pass him by as one too
strong and sturdy to try to weaken. He had a
superb physical form, and as soon as he was old
enough to take regular exercise he added to his
suppleness and strength in a systematic way.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no better runner, jumper, swimmer,
diver or all-around athlete in Bedford than Joe
Strong. Added to this he could ride any horse he
ever saw; he could climb to the roof of the church
and walk the ridge pole, with never a qualm of dizziness;
he was an excellent shot with a rifle; and
he could juggle with stones, baseball bats, balls—in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>fact with almost anything that he could handle.
Taking it all in all, Joe was rather remarkable.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another point in his favor, and one that was destined
to stand him in good stead in after life, was
the fact that he seemed absolutely without nerves.
Rather be it said that his nerves were under such
perfect control that he was their master, not their
slave. It took high-strung but perfectly controlled
nerves to do some of the things Joe did.</p>

<p class='c007'>The secret of his abilities, if secret it was, lay
in the fact that his mother, now dead some years,
had been one of the most daring bareback riders
in any circus that ever toured the country. She
was billed as Madame Hortense, though her name
was Mrs. Janet Strong. She was an English
woman, and Joe dimly remembered hearing that
before her marriage her name had been Willoughby.
Beyond that fact he knew little of his mother’s
early history.</p>

<p class='c007'>But it was not alone from his mother that Joe
inherited certain health, nerve, daring, ability to ride
a horse and to take risks higher up off this solid
earth than most persons care to go. He also was
indebted to his father for many of his talents and
abilities.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Morretti—known in private life as
Alexander Strong—had been in his day, one of the
best-known and best-drawing (from a theatrical
standpoint) magicians that ever brought a live rabbit
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>out of a silk hat, or locked himself up in a solid
box, only to be found missing when the box was
opened, the professor himself afterward walking
coolly down the aisle of the playhouse.</p>

<p class='c007'>Thus Joe inherited two totally different sets of
talents. And that was about all he had inherited
from his parents. For they had both died when he
was about five years old, the professor first, following
a severe attack of pneumonia contracted when
one of his water tricks went wrong, and he received
a drenching on a zero night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Strong did not long survive her husband.
Perhaps she lost her nerve, following news of his
sudden death. At that they were traveling in different
shows, Joe being with his mother. Usually,
however, Professor Morretti and Madame Hortense
went about together, caring for little Joe between
them.</p>

<p class='c007'>Only a few months after the professor died,
Madame Hortense had a bad fall from a new horse
she was trying, and she received injuries which
resulted in her death in a few weeks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was left alone in the world, with only an inheritance
of a superb set of muscles, nerves, hawklike
eyes and an active brain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The circus people were kind to him, and did what
they could, but a circus is not the best place in the
world for an orphan boy, and the manager soon
realized this.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>Consequently he was glad to read an advertisement
of a couple who wanted to adopt a strong,
healthy boy of about Joe’s age. Letters were written,
and Mr. Amos Blackford came on with his wife
to have a look at Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Beeze, the circus manager, had artfully
neglected to state, in his early letters, the fact that
Joe was the orphan of a bareback rider and a “Professor
of Black Art and Magic”; and when Mr. and
Mrs. Blackford discovered this they were well-nigh
horrified. For they were old-fashioned persons,
with very strict ideas about right and wrong, and
to them a woman who rode a horse in a circus was
a person not to be admitted to the best society, and
they regarded the dead Professor Morretti in about
the same light as they would an outlaw.</p>

<p class='c007'>At first they were going back without Joe. But
Mrs. Blackford could not resist the heart-appeal of
the attractive little chap, and so he was taken,
and carried to the Blackford home in Bedford by
his foster-parents, who had since brought him up.</p>

<p class='c007'>They had done well by Joe, as far as their rather
narrow minds let them. They treated Joe harshly
at times, without understanding that they did so.
They wanted him to forget that he was ever in a
circus, that his mother ever rode bareback, and
that his father juggled Indian clubs and produced
live rabbits from the vest pockets of innocent persons
in the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>But Joe could not forget those things. He had
been born in a circus, and the smell of the sawdust,
the jungle odor from the animal tent, always
brought back to him, most vividly, his early days.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had not lived long in Bedford before he
became known as a daring little fellow. Mrs.
Blackford nearly fainted when once she saw him
walking the back fence like a tight rope, with a
clothes pole as a balancer in his chubby hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>And from then on, by gradual stages, Joe advanced
to more and more daring tricks, until one
day on a challenge he walked the ridgepole of the
church.</p>

<p class='c007'>His foster-father whipped him for that—whipped
him cruelly—and from that time Joe came to dislike,
with a dislike that never ceased, the man who
had brought him up. From then on his life was
more or less miserable. But he did not give up what
was born to him in his blood. In secret he imitated
the acts of circus performers, remembering some
of them from his childhood days, seeing pictures
of others on the gaudy fence bills, and, rarely,
getting into a show himself. That was his seventh
heaven of delight.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the years went on, Joe gained in health,
strength, nerve and daring. Joe was not a paragon—far
from it. But he was certainly a remarkable
youth, and perhaps “daring” is the best word to use
in describing him. He seemed never to be afraid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>to take a chance, but, if the truth were known, his
keen eye and active brain had already figured the
chances out in his favor before he undertook any
feat.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now, on this sunny day, he was sitting under
a willow tree with his companions, discussing a
show given the night before by Professor Rosello.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you mean to tell me, Joe,” asked Tom Simpson,
“that you can do <i>any</i> of those tricks the professor
did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some of ’em, yes,” answered Joe. “Of course
I can’t do those that need a whole lot of trick apparatus,
a darkened stage, and all that. I could if
I had the stuff. But I think I can do the one you
were talking about as I came up,” and Joe regarded
his companions with sparkling eyes.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mean the slate trick?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Adding up a sum and making the answer
come on the slate. I could do that now, if I had the
slate. That was the only trick thing about it all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Was that slate a trick one?” asked Charlie,
rumpling up his red hair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. It was a trick slate, but not very complicated.
Now just watch a moment and I’ll do
the trick, as nearly like the professor as is possible.
I guess I’ve got some papers and a pencil.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From his pocket Joe brought out some white slips
and a stub of a pencil.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now you fellows just sit in a row a little way
<span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>apart, and I’ll pretend this is the stage,” went on
Joe, as he stood beside a flat stump near the willow
tree. “Here, Charlie, you put down a number on
this slip of paper. Any number of four figures,
say 1,876, or anything you like.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” said Charlie, and he wrote a number.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now, Harry, you set down a number under
Charlie’s,” directed Joe, “and then it will be
Henry’s turn. This is the way the professor did it,
isn’t it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, only he talked more,” replied Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I could sling the ‘patter,’ as they call it,
if I wanted to,” said Joe. “Only as I’m going
to show you how the trick is worked I don’t need
a lot of talk.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you really going to show us?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure I am! Now, Harry, if you’ve got your
number written pass the paper to Henry. You set
down a number of four figures, Henry, and draw
a line under the sum. Tom, you’re pretty good
at addition, aren’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Pretty fair, yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I don’t want any mistake made,” Joe,
with a smile, warned them. “Here you go now.
Add up those figures Tom, and get ’em right,”
and he passed a slip of paper to the boy who had
not set down any of the numbers. “Add ’em up,
and set the result down in pencil under the line
Henry drew. When you’ve done that I’ll make the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>answer appear on this flat piece of stone. Here,
you hold it, Charlie,” and picking up a flat stone
from the ground, Joe threw his handkerchief over
it and passed it to Charlie to hold. “Don’t take
off the handkerchief until I tell you to,” he warned
the lad.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is the sum added, Tom?” asked Joe, a moment
later.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ten thousand, four hundred and sixty-seven.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good!” cried Joe, and, unconsciously perhaps,
he imitated the language, manner and gestures of
Professor Rosello. “Now then,” went on the
boy wizard, “you three boys each set down a
separate number. None of you knew what the
others wrote, and Tom, who didn’t write any figures,
announces the sum of the other three fellows’
numbers to be ten thousand four hundred and sixty-seven.
Am I right, Tom?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right Here’s the paper. I’m sure I
added ’em up right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ve no doubt but you did, Tom. Now
then, I think you’ll agree that I didn’t know beforehand
what numbers you fellows were going to
write, so, of course, I couldn’t tell what they’d
add up to. Could I?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see how you could,” admitted Henry,
but a little doubtfully.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>“Well, now comes the magic part. I’m going,
without touching it, to cause this sum, which Tom
announces as ten thousand four hundred and sixty-seven,
to appear on that flat stone Charlie holds
under the handkerchief. I won’t touch the stone,
which answers the same purpose as the professor’s
slate. But I’ll take the paper you have, Tom,
with the sum of ten thousand four hundred and
sixty-seven on it,” and Joe did so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now to make the trick more simple I’ll just
burn this paper with the sum on, where you can all
see it,” Joe went on. He held up the paper in
plain sight and set fire to it with a match.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will now pronounce the magic words: <i>oshkalaloolu
presto, smacko!</i> The sum has now vanished
in smoke, and will appear on the flat stone.
Charlie, lift the handkerchief and hold up the stone
so we can all see it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Charlie did so, and there, in black pencil on the
gray surface of the stone, was the answer to the
little sum—10,467!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whew!” whistled Charlie. “How under the
sun did you do it, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And right under our very noses, too!” added
Tom, in amazement.</p>

</div>
<p class='c006'>Joe Strong smiled at the puzzled looks on the faces of his chums. They were eagerly watching
him now, as if asking what he would do next.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I can’t do anything more just now,” he
said in answer to the implied request. “I can’t
produce a guinea pig from Tom’s ear, nor a bowl
of gold fish from under my shirt; though I might
if I were loaded for those tricks.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Loaded?” asked Charlie, curiously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, that is what a magician calls it when he
comes out on the stage, with the secret pockets of
his dress suit filled with the things he needs for
tricks. He may ‘load’ himself with a bowl of gold
fish or a couple of rabbits.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Alive?” asked Henry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure! Wasn’t the rabbit alive Professor
Rosello took out of dad’s hat last night?” asked
Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did he do that?” Charlie interrogated
“Can you tell us, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I can, but——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>“Say, I’d rather have him tell us how he did this
trick with the figures,” interrupted Harry. “Go
on, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it’s really very simple when you know,”
said Joe. “You see the sum I made appear
on the stone wasn’t the sum of the numbers you
three fellows wrote down.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It wasn’t?” cried Tom, surprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” went on Joe Strong, with a twinkle in his
bright eyes. “I let Harry, Charlie and Henry each
set down four figures on a piece of paper. Then
I handed a piece of paper to Tom to add up the
sum, only it didn’t happen to be the same piece
that you three fellows used,” and Joe laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I just substituted one of my own,” resumed the
boy wizard. “I had it in my pocket all ready, for
I thought maybe I’d get a chance to play this trick
to-day. I wadded up in a little ball the paper with
the figures you boys set down, and slipped Tom one
of my own. Of course I knew what my numbers
were going to add up to—I had put down the figures
myself, so I ought to know. They were
like this:”</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>4,004</div>
      <div class='line'>2,821</div>
      <div class='line'>3,642</div>
      <div class='line'>—————</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Joe showed the little sum, rapidly scribbling it
on another piece of paper.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>“Those figures add up to ten thousand four hundred
and sixty-seven,” he resumed, “and of course
I knew that before Tom announced the sum. And
I knew I was safe in letting Tom have the list of
figures I wrote, for he had not seen those you fellows
had set down. I made my set of figures look
as though a different person had set down each
one, and Tom wasn’t familiar enough with you
boys’ way of making figures to detect the change.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then, when I took the piece of paper from
him, I burned that and with it the one that Charlie,
Henry and Harry had written their figures on,
so there wouldn’t be any chance of being found out
later.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how did you get the sum, ten thousand four
hundred and sixty-seven, on the piece of stone?”
asked Charlie. “You didn’t touch that after you
took the paper from Tom, I can vouch for that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I didn’t touch it,” affirmed Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then how did the figures get on? There must
have been some magic about that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s very simple when you know how,” laughed
Joe. “When I was talking here to you fellows, I
just put the sum, ten thousand four hundred and
sixty-seven on the flat side of the stone with a
pencil. Then I turned it over and left it lying
on the ground until I wanted it. Then it was easy
enough for me to pick it up, cover it with a handkerchief
and hand it to Charlie to hold. The sum
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>was there on it all the while, and when Tom announced
what my three figures added up to, a result
that I, of course, knew beforehand, I simply
had Charlie lift the handkerchief, and—there you
were!”</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment there was silence among the boys.
Then they burst out with:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll be jiggered!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“As easy as that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s a wonder we didn’t think of that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Two papers—one with our numbers on, and
one with his!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the whole secret,” explained Joe. “That
is, all but the stone. Of course if I had had a slate
to use that would have been a little different.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what I don’t understand,” observed
Charlie. “That professor last night passed the slate
around for inspection, and there wasn’t any number
written on it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes there was,” said Joe with a smile.
“Only you didn’t see it. It was a trick slate. On
one side, covered by a piece of black stiff paper,
which looked almost like the slate, was the number
written in chalk—a number that was the sum
of three figures previously known to the professor,
and on the piece of paper he gave out to be added
up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When he took back the slate, after having
passed it around for inspection, he walked up on to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>the stage and quietly slipped out the piece of black
paper. That left the chalk sum exposed. He
could either do that before he covered the slate
with the handkerchief and gave it to some one to
hold, or afterward, as he took it from the person
and raised the handkerchief covering. In his case
he did it before, since he let the person holding
the slate lift the handkerchief.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then the number was there all the while!”
cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if the one who held the slate had lifted
the handkerchief it would have been seen?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. And for that reason it’s safer to lay the
slate on a table or on the stage in plain sight, but
where no one can inspect it. Then the magician
can ask some one to come up and lift the handkerchief,
so it can’t be said he wrote the number
down himself. That’s all there is to it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, it does sound easy now,” commented
Charlie. “But how did you ever figure it out,
Joe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you surely did the trick smoothly!” was
Tom’s compliment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’ve studied it a little,” admitted Joe, modestly.
“It needs a little practice in ‘palming,’ that
is in holding two or more things in your hand without
letting the audience suspect you have them; or
in changing one thing for another by sleight-of-hand,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>as I changed the papers. You see it’s very
easy—like this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He picked up a small stone, held it on the back of
his left hand, passed his right quickly over it and
closed both fists.</p>

<p class='c007'>“In which hand is the stone now?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There,” said Tom, indicating the right fist.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, there,” said Charlie, quickly, touching the
left.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither one, it’s there on Henry’s knee,” announced
Joe with a laugh, and so it was, the same
stone, for it was peculiarly marked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you do it?” cried Henry, in frank
amazement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, just by making the action of my hands
quicker than your eyes,” was the answer. “I made
a couple of false motions, and you followed them
with your eyes instead of watching the stone.
That’s how I managed to substitute the paper with
my figures on for the one Tom thought you boys
had prepared. It’s very simple.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, to hear you tell it,” came from Henry.
“But say, Joe, how did the professor do that trick
with the live rabbit? I was close to him when he
came down off the platform, and I couldn’t see where
he had the bunny. And yet, in plain view, he pulled
it out of somebody’s inside coat pocket. How in
the world did he do it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was easy—for him,” Joe stated. “When he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>finished the hat and egg trick he went behind the
scenes for a second and slipped the live rabbit in
a secret pocket in his coat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“After some hocus-pocus work, and a lot of
‘patter,’ or talk made up to keep you from watching
him too sharply, he went close to the man from
whose pocket he was going to produce the rabbit.
He held the lapel of the man’s coat close against
his own for a second, and with his other hand he
reached in the secret pocket and got hold of the
rabbit’s ears. Then, when he lifted the bunny up,
it looked just as if the animal came out of the
man’s pocket, but, all the while, it came from the
professor’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Huh!” exclaimed Tom. “It all sounds very
easy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is, and again it isn’t,” explained Joe. “It
takes lots of practice, and one’s got to have his
nerve with him all the while, to know how to act
in case anything goes wrong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then <i>you</i> ought to be a good wizard,” declared
Henry, “for you sure have nerve!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” added Harry Martin. “But say
now, Joe, in that trick where the professor
took——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Harry did not finish his sentence. His words
were cut short by an explosion which came from
a group of buildings located near a railroad siding
about a quarter of a mile away. Following the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>explosion a cloud of black smoke billowed up to
the sky.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look, fellows!” cried Tom. “It’s the fireworks
factory!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s on fire!” added Henry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s blown up!” yelled Charlie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, boys! Come on!” shouted Joe, and
he led the way toward the cloud of smoke, which
was now pierced here and there by darting tongues
of fire. As the boys rushed onward there came
other and smaller explosions, like the popping of
guns.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER III<br> <span class='large'>TO THE RESCUE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>For a few moments after the excitement caused
by the explosion and fire, the five boys rushed on
together, saying nothing. Their eyes were fixed
on the distant group of burning buildings, which,
being of light and flimsy construction (as is always
the case with fireworks factories and powder mills),
were burning rapidly. They occupied quite an
extent of territory, being well separated so that
if one blew up or caught fire there would be less
likelihood of all being consumed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She sure is a hummer!” cried Harry, as he
raced along beside Charlie Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right!” joined in the red-haired lad.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The whole thing’s likely to go up if the wind
doesn’t shift,” commented Henry Blake. “It’s
blowing the flames right toward the main building
now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and they’re all pretty well filled,” said
Joe Strong. “This is their busy season, getting
ready for the Fourth, you know. There’ll likely
be a lot more explosions, and a final big one.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>“There goes one now!” cried Tom Simpson.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke there was a burst of flame and smoke
from one of the buildings that had not before
caught fire, and then followed an explosion louder
than any of the previous ones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There she goes!” shouted Harry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And look at the rockets!” added Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>A sheaf of sky rockets, part of a shipment just
finished, had become ignited and now were whizzing
up in the air, bursting with loud reports far
above the earth, for they were large-sized pyrotechnics.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If this were only night it would be a grand
sight!” murmured Charlie, narrowly missing a fall
as he stumbled over a stone.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too bad they couldn’t wait,” commented Joe,
grimly. “Say! I wonder if any one’s hurt. It
came so suddenly that a lot of the workers may
be trapped in there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s so,” agreed his chums. They increased
their pace. They could now see others running to
the fire—men, boys, and some women and children,
coming from the direction of the town.
Others were leaving their work in fields, gardens,
or in houses to view the unusual sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was not a little alarm, too, for many of
the men and some girls and boys of the town
worked in the Universal Fireworks Factory, particularly
at this season of the year.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>The factory was located close to the freight station
of the Bedford and Point Barrow Railroad, a
spur, or short track, running in among the factory
buildings. On the sidings were a number of freight
cars, which carried big red signs, marked: “Dangerous!
Explosive! Keep all lights away!”</p>

<p class='c007'>But there was plenty of light now, even though
the glaring sun took away the effect that would
have prevailed had there been darkness—plenty
of light and fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She sure is a hummer!” cried Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A hum-dinger,” added Harry. “Listen to
that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Another explosion occurred, lifting a roof off
one of the frail buildings, and depositing the blazing
mass over on the railroad tracks, and rather
dangerously near the passenger depot, which was
not far from the freight station.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There goes the fire alarm!” cried Harry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ll be here in no time. It’s a general alarm
when anything like a fireworks factory goes up,”
said Joe. “There they come,” he added, as he
looked back toward the town, and pointed to an
automobile fire-fighting apparatus coming along the
road. The auto-engine was a new purchase for
Bedford. Besides that, there was an old steamer,
drawn by hand whenever horses could not be requisitioned
in a hurry.</p>

<p class='c007'>The five boys had to cross the small stream,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>known locally as Bedford Creek, in order to reach
the scene of the fire. As they rushed along across
the fields toward the water, all but Joe bore off to
the left. He kept straight on.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where you going?” asked Harry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To the fire, of course,” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The bridge is over this way,” stated Tom, indicating
a white structure that crossed the stream
some distance to the left of where the boys then
were.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bridge!” cried Joe. “Do you think I’d waste
time crossing a bridge when there’s a fire like this
straight ahead of me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How are you going to get across the creek?”
Harry queried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wade or swim, of course. It’s a hot day!”</p>

<p class='c007'>And while Tom, Harry and the others ran on
toward the bridge, Joe Strong, coming to the edge
of the creek, which at this point was deeper and
wider than at any other, waded out without a moment’s
hesitation.</p>

<p class='c007'>For a moment his chums watched him, fascinated.
Then they shook their heads, and kept
on toward the bridge.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He sure has got nerve!” asserted Henry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Joe’s there with it every time,” added Tom.
“I wish I dared do that. But if I got wet with all
my clothes on, I’d be in for a good scolding when
I got home.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>“Joe may be, too—or worse,” said Charlie. “I
hear that he and Deacon Blackford don’t get along
any too well of late. He’s given Joe several
touches of the whip and strap, and Joe’s not a fellow
to stand much of that sort of treatment.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t blame him for not standing it,”
commented Henry. “Deacon Blackford may mean
all right, but we all know he’s totally ashamed to
have it known what Joe’s father and mother were.
As if it could be a disgrace to have had a mother
who was a dandy circus rider, and a father who
was a top-notcher when it came to magic. I’d be
proud of it if my folks were that sort.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So would I,” added Harry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s where Joe gets his nerve,” remarked
Tom. “Nerve to do just what he did now—swim
the creek.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and that’s where he gets his liking for
magic tricks and for his circus stunts,” added
Charlie. “He sure is a great boy, and strong.
Why, say! you ought to have seen him on the
trapeze I put up in our barn the other day. He
did one giant swing and then he slid down a rope
in a way that——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look, there goes another building!” interrupted
Henry, and the boys, racing for the bridge,
forgot, for the time, to discuss Joe and his doings,
in watching the progress of the fire, to which they
were much nearer now. They could hear the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>crackle of the flames and the popping of small
pieces of fireworks.</p>

<p class='c007'>Charlie turned back to look at Joe. The young
wizard, for such he later became, had waded out
until he found himself getting beyond his depth,
then he plunged into the water, fully clothed as
he was, and began to swim.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was a good swimmer, and he had on a light
summer suit and tennis shoes, so he was not as
hampered as otherwise he might have been. But
swimming in a full suit was nothing for Joe. He
had done it before in a camping contest, and
he had plunged in once, in midwinter, in a
heavy suit, to rescue a little girl from the icy
stream.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was a wonderful swimmer, though he could
not yet do any fancy tricks. He was just doing the
plain Australian crawl stroke, which puts one
through the water in wonderfully good time. On
and on he swam, gaining the other side, and was
very close to the fire before his companions had
reached the bridge. That was where Joe’s nerve
and daring stood him in good stead.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the beginning he had no particular object in
getting to the fireworks fire in such a hurry. It
was just curiosity on his part, as it was on the part
of his companions. Then another thought came
to Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he climbed up the bank on the other side,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>water dripping from every part of him, the youth
thought:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t be surprised but what somebody got
hurt in this fire. It came so suddenly they can’t all
have escaped. It isn’t going to be any easy job to
put it out, either. They’ll need all the help they can
get together. There go some of the railroad men
to give a hand.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was out on level ground now, near the railroad
tracks, and he utilized them as the shortest
way to the fire. He looked back to see his chums
who had crossed the bridge and were now laboriously
racing onward. Their long run had tired
them, whereas the swim Joe had taken had refreshed
him, as the day was warm.</p>

<p class='c007'>The shrill sound of the fire apparatus siren could
now be heard, mingling with the whistle of the
steamer, for the engineer, seeing the smoke and
blaze from afar, and knowing the need, had started
a fire under the boiler, ready for quick work when
he should have reached the scene of the conflagration.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe joined the running, panting throng of men
and boys that now came swarming from all directions
to the fire. The crew of a freight train,
drawn up at the Bedford station, had come over to
do what they could, and the fire-fighting force of
the factory itself was busy. They had a small
steamer on the premises, and lines of hose were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>connected to the steam pump in the boiler room.
Water was soon being poured on the blaze, and
when the auto-apparatus and the old-fashioned
steamer arrived, they, too, were put into service.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time Joe’s chums had joined him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You beat us to it,” panted Charlie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sure I did!” exclaimed Joe. “Why didn’t you
fellows take a chance in the creek?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We didn’t want to spoil our clothes,” said Charlie.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right. It didn’t improve mine any,” admitted
the young wizard, as he looked down at his
sodden garments. “I expect dad will ask me to
step out to the woodhouse when I get home,” Joe
said grimly. He called Mr. Blackford “dad,” and,
as a matter of fact, up to the time he was eight
years old Joe had not appreciated the fact that
“the deacon,” as he was often called, was only his
foster-parent. Joe had but a hazy idea of his real
father and mother, and the change at his early age
failed to impress him. Later he heard the real
story, however.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I guess I’ll get a talking to, anyhow,” he
went on. “But I couldn’t wait to come over the
bridge. Say, she’s going some! isn’t she?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what!” commented Tom. “Look, there
goes the big building!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The main structure, which up to now had suffered
neither from explosion nor from fire, was seen
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>to be smoking on one side. Hoarse orders came
from the fire chief to play streams on that in an
effort to save it, and the fire-fighters drew closer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anybody hurt, did you hear?” asked Charlie
of Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, but some had narrow escapes. A few of
the girls had to jump, but it wasn’t far, for most
of the buildings are only two stories high.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was true of all, in fact, save the main structure,
where most of the fireworks were stored.
That was four stories high, and constructed partly
of brick. It was an old mill turned into a fireworks
factory, the other structures being built around
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If that main building catches—good-night! I’m
going to leave this spot!” said Henry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, it will be healthier a bit farther on,” agreed
Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, look!” suddenly cried Harry. “There’s
a man on the top floor of the store-house! Look!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He pointed. The others followed the direction
of his outstretched finger. They saw a small door
open near the roof of the main building. It was a
door with a projecting beam above it—a beam such
as in barns and mills is used for hoisting bags of
grain or bales of hay. And, for the moment, a
man stood outlined in this small, open door.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, suddenly, the man was seen to crumple up
and fall in a heap on the very edge of the opening.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>So close to the edge did he fall that there came a
gasp of horror from the throng, for it looked for
an instant as if he would topple out and fall to the
ground below.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—why, that’s the professor—Professor Rosello,
who did the magic tricks last night!” cried
Harry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So it is!” agreed Tom. They had recognized
him in that brief instant. What he was doing on
the top floor of the main building of the fireworks
factory could only be guessed then.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he hadn’t fainted, or been overcome by smoke
or flames, or whatever happened to him,” said
Henry, “he might have slid down the rope and
been saved. As it is now, he’s in danger.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A rope dangled from the beam above the door
to the ground below. It ran through a pulley, and
was evidently used to hoist and lower materials
into and out of the factory.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe Strong, with an exclamation, suddenly darted
forward toward the building, which, in spite of the
streams of water poured against it, was now on
fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you going to do?” cried Harry,
reaching out his hand to hold back his chum.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get that man—the professor!” answered Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you—you can’t do it!” protested Henry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t I? You just watch me!” cried Joe, as
he broke into a run. He was headed straight for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>the dangling rope that hung from the beam. It
was right in front of the open door, where the
motionless form of the magician lay.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe Strong was going to the rescue.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IV<br> <span class='large'>JOE’S FEAT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>There was so much going on—firemen and
eager volunteers working at the hose and apparatus,
railroad men and factory employees endeavoring
to get out of the danger zone a car loaded with
explosives, others removing from the factory and
store-houses some of the powder, still others rushing
here and there, uselessly shouting—there was
so much of this sort of thing going on that, for a
moment, no one noticed Joe Strong except his four
chums.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the lad had no sooner reached the foot of
the dangling rope than others saw him, among them
some firemen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come back from there!” they shouted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not just yet!” coolly answered Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you going to do?” a railroad man
inquired.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Get him!” replied Joe, briefly, as he pointed to
the huddled figure lying in the low doorway up
above.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t do it! That place is all on fire inside.
It may go up any minute.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>“Well, I figure that I’ve got a minute to spare,
and a minute is about all I want,” answered Joe
calmly.</p>

<p class='c007'>By this time he was going up the rope hand over
hand, not an easy feat, but Joe seemed to make
nothing of it. Now, if ever, he blessed the time he
had spent in acrobatic work, in emulating the tricks
of circus performers, his own mother included.
Now, if ever, he was glad of his strong and supple
muscles, his cool head and eyes that never faltered.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up and up he went, hand over hand, climbing
the rope like a veritable monkey, and with a skill
that would have caused applause to break forth at
any other than this critical time. As it was, there
was a murmur of admiration for Joe’s coolness and
daring. For it was a daring feat.</p>

<p class='c007'>All this while the fighting of the fire was going
on at other parts of the plant. There had been
no loud explosions for some time, though small
ones were constantly to be heard. And inside the
factory’s flimsy buildings, most of which were in
flames, could be heard the hissing and spluttering
of various forms of pyrotechnics.</p>

<p class='c007'>Up and up went Joe until in a very short time
he swung in through the small door, and stood beside
the prostrate man, whom some of the boys had
recognized as Peter Crabb, otherwise known as
Professor Rosello, the magician.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s there!” cried Charlie Ford.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>“Yes, Joe’ll get him down if there’s any way
to do it!” chimed in Henry Blake.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if there isn’t a way, Joe will make one!”
declared Tom Simpson.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe’s chums and others in the crowd could see
the young wizard now bending over the huddled
form of the professor. They saw Joe hauling up
the rope to get at the free end which was on the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then came a burst of flames and smoke from
a window in the second story, directly past which
Joe had climbed a moment before, and past which
he must lower the unconscious form of the magician;
for that, evidently, was his intention. Could
it be done?</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll never do it!” some one said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’re both goners!” was the general comment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The place is all on fire inside. No chance to
save it,” a fireman remarked. “We’d all better
get back, for she’ll explode soon.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on down, Joe!” a voice cried. “Save
yourself!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe answered something. What it was no one
could hear above the crackle of the flames and the
puffing of the engines.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joe won’t come down without him,” said Henry
Blake in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what he won’t,” agreed Harry Martin.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>But how was Joe to lower the man past that
outburst of flame? Even a momentary passage
through it would likely cause death if the man
inhaled the fire. At best, he would be terribly
burned.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Joe Strong knew what he was doing. As
the crowd watched, they saw him take off his soaking wet
coat and trousers, wet from his swim
across the creek. In another instant Joe had
wrapped and twisted the sodden garments around
the form of the magician, covering his head and
face.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was then the work of but an instant for Joe
to fasten the rope about Professor Rosello. Joe
was an expert in tying knots, and soon he swung
the form, encased in wet garments, free of the
window ledge. Down he lowered the man, swiftly,
right through the outburst of flame. The rope was
charred but not burned through.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I knew Joe’d think of a way!” shouted Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how’s he going to get down himself?”
gasped Harry. “He can never do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was a puzzling question for his chum.
Joe seemed doomed. But the lad himself never
seemed to give this a thought. He stood in the
open, upper doorway, attired in only his wet undergarments.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flames, spurting out from the window below
him, seemed fiercer than ever. The rope would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>never stand another trip past them. And now a
series of small explosions in the building on the
upper floor of which Joe stood indicated that that
building soon would go in a burst of fire and smoke.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Joe knew there was a life net carried on
the auto fire engine, and he depended on this.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chief of the Bedford department had not
lost his head, and Joe had no sooner lowered the
form of the magician to the ground when the quick
mind of the chief was directed to saving the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bring up that life net!” he shouted through his
trumpet. It had been made ready some time
before, but had not been used, since most of the
employees had been rescued from the first floors.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stand here with it!” directed the chief, indicating
a spot out in front of, and directly in line
with, the open doorway in which Joe still stood.
Now the smoke was swirling more thickly about
the lad, and back of him could be seen dancing
tongues of fire.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can you jump it, Joe?” called the chief through
his trumpet</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right! Hold her steady! I’m coming!”
cried Joe, shrilly, above the crackle of the flames.</p>

<p class='c007'>A fire department life net consists of a big iron
ring, which can be folded in half upon itself.
Around the circumference of the ring is woven a
strong rope net, sagging toward the middle. Firemen
stand in a circle about the iron ring, grasping
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>it with their hands, and holding it as high as
possible to allow for the recoiling impact of the
falling body.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you ready down there?” cried Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All ready!” answered the chief. “Brace yourselves
now, men!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe poised for an instant on the edge of the
doorway. It was a sixty-foot jump, but he hesitated
only an instant. With his hands to his sides,
standing as straight as an arrow, his superb form
beautifully outlined, clad as he was only in his
underclothes, Joe jumped.</p>

<p class='c007'>Straight as a plummet he came down, feet first,
into the life net. It sagged with his weight, and
the men holding it were jerked forward, but there
were so many of them that the elasticity of the apparatus
was preserved, and Joe bounced up like
a rubber ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another bounce and he turned a somersault,
landing on the turf at one side.</p>

<p class='c007'>A cheer went up from the rescuers. Joe had
been saved, and he had saved the life of the magician
in a thrilling manner. Another cheer rang
out. But there was no time for more. There was
still the fire to fight.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe’s chums gathered about him, eager to clasp
his hand, to clap him on the back, to utter words of
praise. But he had but one thought—or, rather,
two.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>“Is the professor all right?” he asked eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” some one answered. “He’d only fainted.
He’s all right now, and not burned a bit, thanks
to your wet clothes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where are my clothes?” demanded Joe. “This
isn’t exactly a bathing beach.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t wear your things,” a fireman informed
our hero. “They’re badly scorched. Here,
wrap yourself in this blanket until you can get
home,” and he extended one of the horse-coverings.
Joe accepted it gratefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better get back from here,” another fireman advised.
“This place is going, and it’s full of powder.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The crowd, as well as Joe and his chums, took
the hint.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the main factory did not go up. The fire-fighters
rallied in force around it, seeing that the
other buildings were doomed, and the bigger part
of the plant was saved. Luckily enough, too, as
had it exploded the force would have been felt a
long distance. The light and flimsy buildings
burned quickly into ashes, and the explosions of
fireworks grew less frequent. The material in the
main building was spoiled by water, but that was
better than having the fire reach it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Little remained to do now, but to guard against
stray sparks in the building that had been saved
at such risk. The crowd began to disperse.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>“Where’s the professor?” asked Joe, moving
about in his blanket like some pale-faced Indian.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They took him to the hotel,” said Tom. “Say,
Joe, don’t you want to stop at our house and get
some of my clothes? It’s nearer than going to
yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good idea. Thanks. I guess I will. I don’t
feel exactly like showing up at home in this rig.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Some one who knew Joe offered to drive him in
his automobile to the Simpson house. Tom, of
course, went with his friend, and Joe was soon
clothed in ordinary garments, having first taken
a bath at Tom’s house, for the smoke had made
him black and grimy.</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER V<br> <span class='large'>JOE’S AMBITION</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Where are you going now, Joe?” asked Tom,
as his chum, after having thanked Mrs. Simpson
for her hospitality, stood, ready to leave the house.
“Going home?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not right away,” Joe answered. “I had an idea
I’d like to call on the professor to see if he was
all right. It isn’t every day I help rescue a man
that way, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Help rescue him!” exclaimed Tom, with an accent
on the first word. “Why, you did it all, Joe!
And, say, I never saw anything done slicker. Using
your wet clothes was just the thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was the <i>only</i> thing,” said Joe. “I knew the
fire wouldn’t get through my soaking wet coat and
trousers in the little while he was exposed to the
flames. But say, Tom, are my clothes too badly
burned to wear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m afraid so, Joe. I had a look at them, and
they seem to be ruined.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Too bad!” and Joe sighed. Mr. Amos Blackford
had the reputation in town of being rather
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>close, and Joe realized this better than any one
else.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The professor ought to get you a new suit,”
Tom asserted, “since you ruined yours saving
him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, that wasn’t the reason I wanted to see him,”
hastily interposed the young wizard. “And if you
go with me, Tom, don’t you dare mention my
burned clothes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe looked so stern as he said this, and Tom so
well knew the firmness of his chum, that he readily
promised to do as Joe wished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I’ll just give him a call at the hotel,”
Joe went on. “There’s time enough for me to go
home—and take what’s coming to me—later,” he
added grimly. “I’ve got another suit, Tom, my
best one. I can put that on and give you back
yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’m not worrying about that, Joe. But
come on, we’ll go to the hotel. I wonder what
the professor was doing up on the top floor of that
fireworks factory, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s one of the things that’s been puzzling
me, Tom. And I don’t mind admitting that it is
one of the reasons why I’d like to meet that prestidigitator.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come along then,” went on Tom. “I’m with
you. You may learn some more of his tricks,
Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>“Oh, I know quite a few already.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You do? You never told us fellows.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, well, I sort of had to keep them under
cover. You know my foster-parents aren’t any too
proud of what my father and mother did for a living.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So I’ve heard, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I’m proud of them!” Joe exclaimed, with
flashing eyes. “I wish I could be such a rider as
I’ve heard my mother was, and as good a magician
as my father. But, as I said, I’ve had to sort
of keep my ambitions under cover.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I have done a little practicing on the side,
though, and I have some books on magic I’m studying.
There’s more to it than most persons suppose.
No, I don’t want to get to the bottom of any of
Professor Rosello’s tricks. I fancy I know most
of them anyhow. But I would like to know what
he was doing in that factory, especially up where
he was when the fire broke out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe he’ll tell us,” said Tom.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the two young men went through the town
the signs of excitement about the fire were still
pretty much in evidence. On all street corners little
groups were talking about it. Several persons
had been overcome with smoke, and one or two
employees were slightly burned, one man seriously,
it was feared.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Joe walked along he and Tom heard more
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>than once a murmur of voices, which could be heard
commenting on Joe’s brave act.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There he goes now!” some one exclaimed.
“The nerviest fellow in seven counties! I don’t
believe there’s a thing Joe Strong doesn’t dare do!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re getting famous, Joe,” commented his
chum.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe smiled, but said nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>They soon found themselves at the one hotel of
Bedford, and, after stating their errand, a bell-boy
came back with the information that Professor Rosello
would see them in his room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s a little knocked out,” the clerk informed
Joe. “Nothing serious, though. He’ll be glad
to see you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And the professor was. He looked from Joe
to Tom as the two lads entered his room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“To whom am I indebted so greatly for the saving
of my life?” asked Professor Rosello, in a
rather formal and old-fashioned manner, which
well became him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He did it!” said Tom, quickly, indicating Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then permit me, my dear young sir, to give you
my most heartfelt and sincere thanks.” He shook
hands gravely with Joe, and resumed: “I am well
aware that mere words are futile at a time like this,
and so I will refrain from uttering many of them.
But, none the less, I do thank you. I did not
realize my danger until after I had been rescued.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>Then I was told it was you who had done it. Even
yet I hardly realize what I went through and my
escape from a great danger. I dare say it will
come to me as a shock, later.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope you’re feeling better,” said Joe, who
was anxious to get the “thanking business,” as he
called it, over with.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I am almost myself again, thank you,” was
the reply. “I did swallow a little smoke, but not
much. I really had no business to go where I did.
You see it was this way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom looked at Joe, as much as to say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now you’ll get your explanation all right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am, as perhaps you know, a sleight-of-hand
performer; a magician, as we are sometimes called.
I gave an exhibition in your town last night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I was there, and liked it first rate!” broke in
Tom. “And Joe here—he showed us——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Tom stopped suddenly, for Joe administered an
unseen, but none the less swift, warning kick, under
cover of a table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I am glad you liked my little entertainment,”
the professor went on, not appearing to notice the
little side-play between Joe and his chum, if, indeed,
he saw it. “As I was saying, I am a modern
magician. As you young gentlemen probably
know, we are always on the lookout for new tricks,
new effects, illusions and so on. Perhaps I need
not tell you that there is really no so-called Black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>Art—nothing really supernatural in my work, or
in that of my fellow artists. We can not overcome
nature, we merely adapt her to our needs. The
old truth of the hand being quicker than the eye
still holds good. In fact it is very easy to deceive
the eye, as you doubtless noticed at my little entertainment.
You see——”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor pulled a red handkerchief from
his pocket, flourished it in the air, stuffed it into his
clenched fist. Pulled out one end to disclose a blue
flag. Then, with a rapid motion, he stuffed it back
into his clenched fist again, to bring it out pure
white, and a moment later, rolling it up into a ball,
he smoothed it out to disclose a miniature United
States flag.</p>

<p class='c007'>This he held out to Tom, who, when he took it,
found that he was grasping a lemon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—what—how did you——?” he stammered.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Merely demonstrating that the hand is quicker
than the eye,” said the professor, smiling.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joe can do——” began Tom, when he was again
stopped by a swift kick under the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I said,” resumed the magician, with a smile,
“I am always on the lookout for new effects. This
morning, when I was waiting for my train at the
station to take me and my effects on to the next
town, where I show night after to-morrow, I noticed
the fireworks factory. It occurred to me that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>might use some simple little piece of fireworks in
demonstrating one of my tricks, so, as I had time
enough, I went over to the office.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They had just what I wanted, and the manager
took me up to the store room to show me different
styles of it. While we were on the second floor
there was an explosion in one of the distant buildings.
The manager rushed away at once, leaving
me there in the factory.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I realized that the fire was somewhere near me,
but I had no idea that it might spread to the building
in which I then was. Left to myself, I strolled
about, looking at the different pieces of fireworks.
I was very much interested. I even went up to the
top story, all alone. Those in the factory must
have rushed out at the first alarm.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I realized that there was a fire, but I fairly lost
myself in working out the details of a new illusion
that came to me while in the factory. I sat down
amid the store of pyrotechnics and became involved
in thought. Then, before I knew it, I was trapped.
I rushed to the opening and must have fainted.
The rest you young gentlemen know better than I.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe had received the information he wanted. The
explanation was a perfectly natural one. Perhaps,
though, no one but a man like Professor Rosello
would have sat down in a fireworks factory, with
a blaze near him, to work out the details of a trick.
But, as he said, he fairly lost himself in a maze
<span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>of thought, and when he did realize his danger it
was almost too late.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now, once more, permit me to thank you
for saving my life. I can offer you no adequate
reward, nor, I imagine, do you want one, Joe
Strong.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe shook his head negatively.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But if ever you are in need of a friend—that
is such a friend, with such limited talents as I possess—don’t
fail to call on Peter Crabb, otherwise
known as Professor Rosello,” he added earnestly.
“I am going to travel on to-night,” he resumed. “I
shall feel well enough then. I can not get the fireworks
I desired, but they will do later.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As I said, if ever you want a friend, don’t
forget me. I may not be able to do much for you,
but such as I can do, I will do gladly. I know many
men and women in such lines of public life as I,
myself, follow, and it may be I can help you to
gratify some ambition.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if you could?” asked Joe, boldly. “I
have only one ambition—that is at present—and
that is, to be what you are.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A magician?” cried Professor Rosello, somewhat
surprised.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” answered Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor was silent a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Young man,” he said, “it is not an easy life.
There are many hardships, and not every one can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>stand them, nor is every one fitted to attempt to
amuse the public as I do. I say that in all modesty,
but there is a certain manual dexterity required, a
certain quickness of motion—of the eye—a certain
amount of nerve——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joe’s got that!” cried Tom, moving away to
escape an expected kick. “And he can do some
tricks, too. You ought to see him do the number
trick you worked last night!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor looked strangely at Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are, perhaps, an amateur?” he asked,
slowly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sort of,” admitted Joe, diffidently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then perhaps you can master the art, after
many years’ practice. If you like, I will test you.
Let me see——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My father was Professor Morretti,” said Joe
in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>The magician started.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Professor Morretti!” he murmured. “Are you
his son?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” said Joe, simply.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Rosello bowed as to an equal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My dear young man,” he said, “I am greatly
interested in you—more so than before. If you
are the true son of Professor Morretti, and if
you have even a small part of his talents, I can predict
for you a brilliant future. He was one of the
greatest of us. I never met him, but it was something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>even to know him by reputation. I am indeed
glad to meet his son—proud to have been saved
by him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And to think I talked to you of years of preparation—that
I had an idea of showing you a few
simple tricks, just to discourage you! For I did
not want you to learn by too bitter experience the
sorrow of failure. And you are Professor Morretti’s
son! I am proud to know you!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VI<br> <span class='large'>A FAMILY JAR</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The meeting between Joe Strong and the magician
had quite a different result from the one our
young wizard had expected. He had not been sure
that his father would be known, even by reputation,
to Professor Rosello, and it was a source of pride
and joy to Joe to see the esteem in which his parent
was held.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There was no more brilliant performer in the
business,” said the magician. “His box trick is
unrivalled to-day, and his mystery of the ringing
bells, while it is done by several, including myself,
lacks the brilliancy and smoothness which he gave
it. I wish I had known him, but, failing in that,
I am glad to know his son.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I am glad to know you,” replied Joe. “It
isn’t often I meet any one who appreciates the profession
of a magician, or of a circus rider. My
mother was that, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So I have heard. She, too, was famous in her
day. So you are an orphan. May I inquire with
whom you live?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>Joe gave the details of his bringing up by his
foster-parents. Professor Rosello was much interested,
and asked many questions.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you serious in wishing to adopt the profession,
or calling, of a prestidigitator?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I certainly am!” answered Joe. “But I know
Mr. and Mrs. Blackford will object to it. They are
even ashamed to have folks know what my father
and mother were.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A foolish pride!” murmured the professor.
“There are as fine and noble men and women in
the circus, or in any theatrical line, as in any other
calling of life. It is hard that such a prejudice
exists against them. I have met it myself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Joe—I am going to call you that, for I
feel as if I had known you a long time. Joe, you
realize, perhaps, that you will have to begin at the
bottom of the ladder in this?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” Joe answered the question eagerly. “Oh,
I don’t suppose I could start in now. I’ve got to
work up to it gradually. It’s just my ambition,
that’s all.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I hope you succeed,” said the magician.
“I wish I could help you. Perhaps I can, later. I
will give you my card, with the names of the places
where I shall be playing for the next month or two.
If you find that you can begin this life, let me know,
and I may find an opening for you with some of
my friends.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“Oh, I don’t imagine I can,” and Joe spoke hopelessly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let me see your hands,” said the professor suddenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe held them out. Firm, muscular hands they
were, well formed, and giving an idea of great
strength.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good!” murmured the magician. “Here, let
me see you palm this,” and from an unseen portion
of his clothing he produced a billiard ball.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe, nothing abashed, at once proceeded to
manipulate the ball. He first exhibited it in one
hand, and then in the other. Finally, showing both
hands empty, he reached over and seemingly took
the ball from off Tom’s head!</p>

<p class='c007'>“Bravo! Very good! Much better than I expected!”
cried the professor. “You have a natural
ability to palm articles. I presume you must have
practiced, also.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“A little,” admitted Joe. He did not state that
many and many a night, in his room, he had gone
through this and other necessary fundamentals in
the magical art, getting ready for the time when he
hoped his ambition should be realized. Now he
was reaping the fruits of his secret practice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, you are a better palmer than many who
are on the stage to-day,” said the professor. “It
would not be fair to you, though, to say that you
have not yet something to learn. But I can see you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>have great promise. I sincerely hope I can assist
you. I will now write out my different addresses
for you. It may be that, some day, I can help
you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor sat down at a table, and began
making out a list of towns where he would play
in rotation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just here it may be stated for the benefit of readers
unacquainted with the prestidigitator’s art, that
“palming,” as it is known in the profession, is the
act of holding an egg, billiard ball, lemon, coin, or
some similar object, in the palm of the hand, by a
slight contraction of the ball of the thumb, in such
a manner that the hand, when the back of it is held
out in front of an audience, appears perfectly empty.
Passing of articles from one hand to another, involves
palming, as does causing to “disappear” certain
articles apparently taken from a person’s hat,
clothes and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Palming is the basis of many tricks. The explanation
of these tricks is very simple, involving
in most cases the exercise of but three principles—palming,
the use of special and secret apparatus,
and the old trick of deceiving the eye by making
certain motions with the hands.</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor talked for some little time longer
with Joe and Tom, and did some tricks there, in
the hotel room, with simple articles, that even Joe
admitted afterward he could not explain.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>“But I’ll soon learn how they’re done,” he said
to Tom, as they came away. “I’m not going to be
stumped by them!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then your going to keep at this ambition of
yours, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I certainly am! I guess it’s in my blood, Tom.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t be surprised.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Rosello had again expressed his profound
gratitude to Joe for saving his life. The
magician had almost fully recovered from the shock
and said he would go on that night to the next town
where he would, later, give a performance. Joe
left with a list of the succeeding places where Professor
Rosello would “play.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now I guess I’d better get home,” said
Joe to Tom. “The folks may be worried about
me, after hearing about the fire. I’ll send your suit
back as soon as I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No hurry about that, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>On the way to the residence of his foster-parents
Joe heard more talk of the fire, and his own brave
act was often mentioned. How the fire started was
not known, but the conjecture was that spontaneous
combustion was the cause. Fires in factories where
Fourth of July articles are made are not rare occurrences.
As a matter of fact, they are rather
to be expected.</p>

<p class='c007'>In this case, the saving of the main building
prevented what might have been a calamity with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>great loss of life. Most of the fire apparatus was
returning as Joe turned down the street where he
made his home with Mr. and Mrs. Blackford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if he’ll raise a row about my clothes,”
thought Joe. To himself he always thought of
Mr. Blackford as “he” and Mrs. Blackford as
“she,” though in conversation with others Joe called
them “dad” and “mother.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As has been mentioned before, Mr. and Mrs.
Blackford did not intend to be unkind. They had
lived hard and strict lives when they were young,
and they did not see why others should not tread
the same path. In consequence they curtailed Joe’s
pleasures, they frowned at every mention of his
parents, and they were, at times, actually harsh and
cruel to him. They excused themselves on the
plea that it was “for his good.” But, undoubtedly,
they were very short-sighted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe would have been much better off had he had
kinder treatment and greater liberty. In fact, at
times, he was treated as a child, though he was, at
the opening of this story, nearly eighteen years
old.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I reckon I’m in for a wigging,” mused Joe,
as he approached the house. “Might as well get
it over with.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He vaulted over the gate, landing easily, though
it was not a low barrier by any means.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Joe! Don’t do that!” cried Mrs. Blackford.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>She had seen him from the window. “You
might spoil your shoes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I guess not,” he answered easily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what has happened to you?” she went on.
“That isn’t your suit! Where have you been?
Did you hear about the fire?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I was there. It was quite a blaze.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what about your suit?” went on the elderly
woman. “This isn’t yours.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I know it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whose is it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tom Simpson’s. He lent it to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But where’s your own?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Burned.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Burned?” Mrs. Blackford’s voice was shrill.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. At the fire. I—er—well, I helped get a
man out, and my suit was scorched. I had to borrow
Tom’s to wear home. Couldn’t wear mine.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Blackford raised her hands in surprise, and
pushed her spectacles to the top of her head in
order better to look at Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, of all things!” she cried. “I never heard
tell of such goings on! The very idea!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s the matter? What has happened?”
asked the rather harsh voice of Deacon Blackford,
as he came up the walk on his way home from the
office of his feed and grain business. “Has that
boy been doing something again?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Doing something! I should say he had!” cried
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>Mrs. Blackford. “He’s got his good suit burned up
at the fire!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?” cried the deacon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I couldn’t help it,” said Joe, in self-defense. “I
had to save that man. It was the only way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Joe told briefly and modestly what he had
done. He did not bring out his true worth in the
matter of the rescue, and he hardly made it plain
that, had it not been for his soaking wet suit, Professor
Rosello might have been fatally burned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Professor Rosello?” queried Mr. Blackford.
“Is he a school teacher, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, sir, he’s a professor of magic.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Magic! You mean one of those worthless characters
who go about giving silly exhibitions, like
the one that was here last night?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, he was the one I saved,” Joe answered.
“I’m sorry about my suit, but it couldn’t be helped.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The idea!” cried Mrs. Blackford.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mr. Blackford looked stern.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A low, public performer!” he murmured. “Was
there no one else to save him—no one who is paid
to do such things—firemen with suits that would
not easily burn? Could not one of them save him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There wasn’t time,” Joe answered. “I just ran
in, climbed up the rope, and lowered him down,
after I tied my wet suit about him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did you get your suit wet?” the deacon
questioned.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>“Swimming the creek.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Swimming the creek! Why did you do that?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To get to the fire quicker. I didn’t want to wait
to go around over the bridge.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Humph!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Deacon Blackford fairly grunted out the word.
He looked sharply at Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I must say,” he exclaimed sharply, “that
you have made a pretty exhibition of yourself! The
idea of first spoiling a suit of clothes by swimming
the creek, and then burning it up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And he had worn that suit only a little over
two years!” put in Mrs. Blackford. “It was his
second best. Oh, what a wasteful and careless
boy you are! It’s a shame!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what I say!” thundered the deacon.
“And, what’s more, you’ll suffer for this, Joe!
You have some money saved up. I shall take this
to pay for the suit you ruined.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t ruin it!” Joe retorted, desperately
enough. “I had to save the man’s life. It was the
only way!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stuff and nonsense!” snapped the deacon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No nonsense at all!” cried Joe, his temper now
thoroughly aroused. “I just had to do it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t talk back to me!” cried his foster-father.
“I’ll teach you not to be impudent to me!” He
drew back his hand as though to strike Joe, but
the latter, after an involuntary closing of his fist,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>stepped back out of the way. Joe’s face was pale.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll not take a blow from you, sir. Not any
more,” he said in a quiet voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You won’t, eh?” stormed the deacon. “We’ll
see what you’ll take and won’t take! You’ll pay
for that suit, that’s sure! And we’ll see who’s boss
here! I’ll strike you if I like! You’re not of age
yet! Now go to your room. I don’t want to act
hastily. Go to your room at once, before I get
angry,” and, with a stamp of his foot, the old man
raised a stern hand and pointed to the stairway.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe turned aside without a word.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VII<br> <span class='large'>MR. BLACKFORD’S TROUBLE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Bitter at heart was Joe Strong as he walked
slowly into his room and shut the door. This was
a common form of punishment with the deacon,
since he had given up his frequent whippings of
Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just what effect the old man thought it had on
the youth to send him to his room it is hard to tell.
But Joe had often been sent there to sit in loneliness,
often without a meal, or at best with bread
and water. At times the deacon declared bread
and water was all Joe could have, but Mrs. Blackford
had a kinder heart, and she would butter the
slices she brought up to Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I had the row all right,” mused Joe, as
he sat down in the chair near a window. “It was
just as I expected. As if I could help getting my
suit scorched!”</p>

<p class='c007'>From his window Joe could look across the fields
to the fireworks factory, now mostly a heap of
ruins. He thought of the professor he had saved,
and he also thought of what Mr. Crabb had said
of Joe’s father and mother.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>“If you were only alive now,” thought Joe, with
a sigh, “things would be different. I’d be with
you in the circus, and what great times we’d have
together!”</p>

<p class='c007'>With shining eyes, in which there was a small
trace of tears, Joe gazed off into the distance. He
realized that his feelings were getting the best of
him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, come, old man!” he told himself. “This
won’t do! Not at all! Not for a minute! You’ve
got to brace up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He arose, raised his arms, and, taking off his
coat, began to go through some simple gymnastic
exercises. Even under his shirt one could see the
ripple and play of his superb muscles. Joe was
not the sort of athlete that develops into a “strong
man.” He was more of the all-around type, though
he did possess unusual strength for a youth of
his age. He could use it to advantage, too. The
trapeze was his favorite, though he could do some
startling feats on the flying rings and the horizontal
bars.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There, I feel better!” Joe announced, as he sat
down, breathing a little faster because of the rapid
exercise he had taken. “But I do wish I had a
regular gym. I could work myself up in better
shape. But what’s the use of wishing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He could hear, from downstairs, the murmur
of the voices of his foster-father and mother.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>“Talking about me, I suppose,” mused Joe.
“Trying to decide what punishment to inflict.
Well, I know one thing, and that is if he tries to
give me a whipping I won’t stand it! No, sir!
That’s the limit! He scolded me enough, and he
humiliates me by sending me up here, as if I were
some five-year-old child. But that’s as far as I’ll
let him go! He shan’t beat me!</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he does—if he does, I’ll——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe paused in his thinking. Again his gaze wandered
off toward the burned factory, and again he
saw, in fancy, the huddled form of the magician.
“That’s what I’ll do!” exclaimed Joe, this time half
aloud. “I won’t wait for him to give me a beating,
which I think he’s planning to do. No, sir, I
won’t wait for that. I’m glad I thought of it. It’s
about the only thing left for me to do. I’ve about
reached the limit.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe went to his closet and took out a suit of
clothes. It was his “best,” kept for Sundays and
special occasions. Then he went to his bureau and
began to look among the drawers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The only thing is about getting this suit back to
Tom,” mused Joe. “I’ll have to do that. If I
left it here they might not give it to him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He paused to listen once more to the murmur
of voices below him. The deacon’s dull and rumbly
and his wife’s shriller.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Still at it!” said Joe grimly.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>From a far and dark corner of the closet Joe
brought out an old valise. It had not often been
used, for Joe seldom traveled. Deacon Blackford
had no money to waste on such “foolishness.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’ll hold about all I’ll want to take with
me,” Joe mused. “Now, the next question is, can
I get out of here without their suspecting? Of
course, I’ll have to do it after dark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe went to a window and looked out. What
he saw satisfied him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t be much of a climber if I couldn’t
get down that,” he murmured with a smile.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t as if this were the first trouble we’d had,”
mused Joe, “nor the first time he’d punished me
unjustly.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe spoke the truth. Though doing what he
thought was the best for his foster-son, Mr. Blackford
was a harsh man. And he did not seem to
realize that Joe was growing up. He made no
allowances for that.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going to quit,” Joe told himself. “I’m going
to light out. I haven’t much money,” and he
looked at the sum in a box that, since he was a little
fellow, had served him as a “bank.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It won’t take me far,” Joe mused. “I can’t
travel in a Pullman car, that’s sure. That is, not
one of the regular ones. A side-door Pullman for
mine!” and Joe smiled as he thought of the tramp’s
designation of a freight car.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>“And after I quit here—well, I guess I can find
something to do. I ought to be able to make my
living.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe laid out his money, and then, rather idly, he
began palming coins, doing various tricks with
them, sending them spinning up in the air seemingly
to vanish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A little out of order,” Joe said, as he missed
one trick. “I’ll have to practice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Joe put the money in his pocket his fingers
came in contact with a paper. He drew it out. It
was the list of towns where Professor Rosello
would play.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what I’ll do,” decided the young wizard.
“I’ll go to him. He said he’d help me if he could.
I don’t imagine he is very rich, but he’s good. And
if he can’t give me anything else he can advise me.
I need that, I’m thinking.”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was now late afternoon, almost time for supper,
and Joe wondered whether he would get anything
to eat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll go whether I do or not,” he said. “I can
buy something after I’m away from here, for I
sure am going.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He could not hear his foster-parents talking now,
and he wondered whether his fate had been decided
on. In such case the deacon might come upstairs
with the whip he occasionally used on Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he comes I won’t let him in,” thought our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>hero, as he locked his room door. “He’ll have to
break that down to get me, and I don’t believe he’ll
do it—cost him too much for repairs. As soon as
it’s dark enough, I’ll slip out the window. No, I
guess I’d better wait until they’re in bed and
asleep. No use taking chances, and I’ve got plenty
of time. I’ll wait until about midnight.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe went on with his preparations for leaving
home. He had no regrets, for, after all, it had
not been much of a home of late.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If only my father and mother were alive!” Joe
said softly. “It sure would be great to travel
around the country with them. My father could
show me all his new tricks, and my mother would
teach me more about horses. But there’s no use
wishing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Joe stood looking out through the window
he saw Deacon Blackford pass, walking down the
street in the direction of the feed and grain store
which he owned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s queer,” mused Joe. “I wonder what
he’s going back to the store for at this hour. He
never does that so near supper time. He must have
forgotten something. Or maybe he’s got something
new in his head about me. I wonder what
he’s going back for?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe might have wondered still more could he
have looked into the feed store a little later. For
Deacon Blackford was in close consultation with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>two men—in such close consultation that it was
necessary to shut and lock the office door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you’ve come back, I see,” remarked one
of the men. He had shifty eyes that did not gaze
straight at the person with whom he was talking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, Denton, I’ve come back, as I said I would,”
replied Mr. Blackford. “But I tell you now, it’s
no use! I’m not going to give up another cent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you give us the papers then?” asked the
man called Denton. He seemed to be pleading,
rather than demanding.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give us the papers,” he went on. “We can get
a little back from the investment then. We won’t
lose it all. If you won’t give us the money give us
the papers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll give us both, Burke, that’s what he’ll give
us!” broke in the other man. This man had a
hard face, and his eyes, unlike those of his companion,
met his opponent’s boldly. But they did
not have a pleasant or safe look—those eyes.
“He’ll give us both, that’s what he’ll give us!” said
this man again. “If he doesn’t he’ll suffer for it!”
and he banged his fist down on the deacon’s desk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, go easy now, Harrison,” advised Burke Denton.
“Go a bit easy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, that’s not my way!” exclaimed Jake Harrison.
“What I want I’ll get, if I have to take it
out of his hide. He went into this investment with
us and——”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>“But you said it would be successful, and that
we’d all make money,” whined the deacon. “I
didn’t think I’d lose.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I told you it wasn’t a dead sure thing,” said
Harrison. “You knew it was a risk when you
went into it. Now we’re in a hole, and you will
have to help us out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And if I refuse?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you’ll be in more trouble. What we want
is money enough to tide us over, or else those
papers, so we can use ’em to raise money on from
some one else. Come now, you’ve got the money
and we know it. We’re going to have it, too!”
And again Harrison banged his fist down on the
desk, so that Mr. Blackford jumped.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a worried look on his face as he
looked at the two men—one shifty, and inclined to
temporize, merely through fear of getting into too-deep
water, the other a bolder and more hardened
character, it seemed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, what do you say?” asked Harrison.
“The papers or the money?”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER VIII<br> <span class='large'>THE RUNAWAY</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Deacon Blackford did not answer at once. He
remained in his seat at his desk, looking first at
one man and then at the other. Often his fingers
would beat a drumming tattoo on the top of the
desk, as though he were too nervous to keep still.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well!” said Harrison, sharply, “what’s it to
be? We can’t wait all night!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we might give him a little more time,” suggested
Denton. “I know what it is——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You keep still!” fiercely interrupted Harrison.
“I know what I’m talking about! We’ve given him
too much time as it is. We need the papers or the
money, and we’re going to get what we want!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I s’pose it’ll have to be as you say,”
weakly agreed the other.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what it will!” was the prompt comment.
“Come now, Blackford, settle up with us about
this investment business. What’s it to be—the
papers or the money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Neither one!” said the deacon sharply. “I
won’t give you any more money. And if you think
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>I’m going to give up the valuable papers, which
represent the only claim I have on you, you’re very
much mistaken. You’ll get neither, and that’s my
last word!”</p>

<p class='c007'>This time he banged his fist down on the desk
with a sudden energy that seemed to surprise even
Harrison. An ugly look came over the face of the
hardened man. He half closed his bold eyes and
leaned forward toward the deacon, craning his
neck forward like some big snake about to strike its
victim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So that’s your answer, is it?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what it is!” declared Joe’s foster-father.
“You’ll get neither the money nor the papers!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, come now,” began Denton, in rather pleading
tones. “You’d better think again, Deacon.
Take a little more time, and——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve had all the time I want,” said Mr. Blackford.
“That’s my last answer—neither the money
nor the papers!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well now, if I were you——” began Denton,
when Harrison stopped him with a fierce gesture.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s enough,” he cried. “If that’s his last
word, it’s ours, too. Come on, Denton.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He arose as if to leave.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I thought we were going to get——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, we’ll get what we want, all right!” broke
in Harrison.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not from me, you won’t!” declared the deacon.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>“We’re not through with you yet, and don’t you
forget it, Amos Blackford,” retorted Harrison, and
his voice was cool and cutting now. “You’ll hear
from us again, and in a way you least expect. Come
on, Denton,” and, turning, the bold-faced rascal
started from the office of the feed and grain dealer.</p>

<p class='c007'>Denton hesitated as though he wanted to stay
and argue the matter further, but Harrison caught
him fiercely by the arm and fairly pulled him outside.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the two men were gone, Deacon Blackford
sat in the now dim office, for dusk was falling.
The grain dealer sat still for about a minute. Then
he said, aloud:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’m well rid of those rascals. I’m glad
I stood out firm against them, or they’d have made
me lose more money. No, indeed, I’ll not give up
those papers, and I won’t sink any more of my hard-earned
cash in their investment schemes. I’m glad
I’m through with them, even if I do lose what I put
into their business. Yes, indeed! And I’m glad
this talk is over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The deacon locked his desk, and prepared to
leave. He had come down to his place of business
at this unusual hour, when all his employees were
gone, on purpose to be alone with the two men to
whom he had granted an interview.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I’m glad it’s over,” he said again. “Now
I can give my mind over to dealing with Joe. That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>boy is certainly a trial to me! It’s the bad blood
of his foolish parents cropping out, I suppose. I
almost wish I had not adopted him, but I thought
he would outgrow the circus and magician instincts.
But they are coming out, in spite of all we
have done. And to think of burning his suit just
to rescue one of those good-for-nothing sleight-of-hand
performers!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The deacon shook his head, walked slowly from
his office, and, after locking the door, started down
the street in the direction of his home.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I really must punish Joe,” he murmured.
“He needs a severe lesson.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re late, Amos,” said Mrs. Blackford, as
her husband came in to supper. “You’re very late.
The victuals are all spoiled, but it’s a pity to cook
anything else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, don’t throw ’em away,” said the old
man quickly. “We can’t afford to waste anything.
I don’t mind if the potatoes are dried up. I can
eat ’em. I haven’t much appetite, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The interview with the two rascals had upset the
deacon more than he thought. He sat heavily
down in his place at the table, while his wife began
to serve the meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What made you so late?” she asked. “And why
did you have to go back to the store? You never
did that before.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I had some business to look after,” Mr.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>Blackford answered. “It was important, but it’s all
settled now. I won’t have to do it again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He began to eat his supper, and then he happened
to think of Joe. Perhaps the sight of the vacant
chair on the opposite side of the table brought the
boy to his mind.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you take him up anything?” he asked his
wife, nodding his head toward Joe’s upper room.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I gave him some bread, just as you told me to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anything else?” asked the old man sharply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well—er—I had plenty of milk so I thought he
might as well have a glass of that instead of water.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Um!” grunted the deacon, but that was all he
said just then. Mrs. Blackford did not add that
she had buttered the bread, and that the slices
were unusually thick, and that she had put one
extra on the plate she handed into Joe’s room.
Mrs. Blackford was a little afraid of the deacon,
but Joe had, on this occasion, profited by her slight
kindness to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>She had taken Joe’s simple meal up to him at the
usual supper time, and he had unlocked his door
while taking in the plate of bread and butter and
the glass of milk. He did not speak, nor did Mrs.
Blackford. It was the regular form of procedure
on such unpleasant occasions as this.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was glad when he saw the milk and the
extra slice of bread.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I’m going to run away,” he thought, “I’ll
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>need all the food they give me. I won’t be able
to get anything at midnight, which is about the
time I leave. I suppose I might raid the pantry,”
he added to himself after a moment’s thought, “but
then they might hear me and stop me. No, I’ll
just have to make this do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He ate the bread and drank the milk, thinking
the while of his future. It was a bold step he
was taking, and yet Joe did not regret having decided
on it. He had reached the limit of patience
as far as his foster-parents were concerned. True,
he owed something to them, but he felt he had more
than paid the debt.</p>

<p class='c007'>For when Joe’s real parents died there was a little
sum of money realized from the sale of Professor
Morretti’s effects, and this the deacon had
taken charge of. He used it to clothe and educate
Joe, taking out a certain sum each year for “board
and lodging.”</p>

<p class='c007'>In consequence the money was all used up, the
last of it about two years prior to the opening of
this story, so that Joe’s little inheritance had paid
his way for some years.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, when the lad was old enough, the deacon,
before and after school hours, had called on Joe’s
strength in the feed and grain business, Joe being
an efficient helper.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deacon was honest in his way, and he allowed
Joe money for this help. But he did not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>overpay the lad and part of what he gave, the deacon
took back for board and lodging, though allowing
Joe a certain sum each week. Joe had saved
most of this, and it was from this horde that the
deacon proposed deducting the money to pay for
the burned suit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he shan’t do it!” said Joe fiercely, as he
felt of the money he had put in the pocket of his
best suit. He was going to wear that when he
left, carrying Tom’s suit, which he intended leaving
on the door-step of the Simpson home, with a
note explaining the circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>After his supper, if one could call it that, Joe
undressed, and lay down on the bed. He was tired
from the day’s excitement, and he realized that he
had a hard night before him. His plans, as yet,
were rather hazy. All he was sure of was that he
was going to run away.</p>

<p class='c007'>Deacon Blackford did not eat much supper. His
wife was rather nervously anticipating another scene
between him and Joe, but the deacon did not mention
the lad’s name. Mr. Blackford sat in glum
silence after the meal. Finally Mrs. Blackford
could stand it no longer. She wanted to know
the worst.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you going to do to—him?” she finally
asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who? Joe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Are you going to—to whip him?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>“I think likely I shall,” answered the old man.
“He’s got to be taught a lesson. But I’ll wait until
morning to do it. I want to do it without getting
angry at him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Blackford breathed a silent sigh of relief.
She felt that if the deacon put off the whipping
until the next day he might not do it at all. And
she dreaded to have it happen. She realized, if
her husband did not, that Joe was too big now to be
whipped.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evening began to lengthen into night, and
the deacon prepared for bed. Joe was listening in
his room for a cessation of sounds that would
indicate it would be safe for him to attempt to
leave. Finally all was still.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe cautiously arose and dressed in the dark.
There was a half-moon, and it gave him illumination
enough to see without making a light in his
room. Putting on his best suit, Joe made a bundle
of Tom’s clothing. The lad had already packed
a valise with his few belongings.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a length of strong fish-line he lowered his
valise from the window to the ground below. He
was glad the deacon’s bedroom was on the other
side of the house. Next Joe lowered the bundle,
and then he prepared to make his way down to the
ground.</p>

<p class='c007'>To do this he was going to lower himself, hand
over hand, on the lightning rod. The deacon was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>old-fashioned enough to have one of these contrivances
on his house, and the twisted, galvanized
rod, in its glass insulating supports, was close to
Joe’s window.</p>

<p class='c007'>To a youth of Joe’s muscle and ability in gymnastics
it was no feat at all to climb down the lightning
rod. On the contrary, Joe thought it fun—or
he would have under pleasanter circumstances.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll just give this a pull or two, to make sure it
will hold me,” Joe mused. “I don’t want to come
a cropper.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Leaning out of his window, he exerted his
strength against the lightning rod. To his dismay
it was loose, and a little stronger pull would have
torn it away from the side of the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whew!” whistled Joe, softly. “That’s bad.
I’ll never dare trust my weight to that. I’d come
down all at once. I wouldn’t mind the fall so very
much, but I’d make a racket, and he’d sure wake
up. Now what can I do? I ought to have tested
that rod this afternoon, and then I could have begun
tearing up the sheets into a rope. Maybe I can do
that now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was about to do this, then decided on a more
straightforward plan.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’re both sound asleep,” he reflected. “I
can easily slip down the stairs and go out the front
door. I won’t make any noise, and it will be safer
even than going down by a bed-sheet rope. That
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>might break or slip off what I tied it to, and I’d
fall anyhow. Yes, I’ll go out the front way, but
I’ll have to be very quiet.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe took off his shoes, unlocked his door with
great caution, and went softly down the stairs. To
his delight they did not creak much, and he soon
found himself in the lower hall.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he was at the front door turning the key,
he heard a sudden noise behind him in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Jinks! He’s heard me!” reflected Joe quickly.
“I’ve got to run for it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He opened the door and fairly leaped off the
steps in his stocking-feet. It was the work of but
an instant to run around the side path, pick up the
bundle of Tom’s clothes and the valise, and then
leap over the fence to the sidewalk. Then, still
carrying his shoes and other things, Joe sped on,
running away, fearful lest the awakened deacon
should run after him.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER IX<br> <span class='large'>THE OVERTURNED LAMP</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The noise which Joe Strong had heard was not
caused, as he had feared, by the rousing of Deacon
Blackford. All things considered, it might have
been well for Joe had it been.</p>

<p class='c007'>While the youth was running away as fast as
he could, considering the fact that he had on no
shoes, but had to carry them, as well as his valise
and a bundle of clothes, something was taking place
back in the deacon’s house that was destined to have
quite an effect on Joe’s life.</p>

<p class='c007'>He had heard a noise, that was certain, and it
had come from the interior of the dark house.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the noise was not made by the deacon. Instead
it came from one of two men who were cautiously
entering the Blackford homestead through
a rear door, which they had opened by the simple
but effective method of “nippering the key.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That is one of them, with a pair of peculiarly
shaped pincers, or nippers, had reached the little
projecting round end of the key that extends beyond
the flat, or ward, part. This is the little end
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>one sometimes sees sticking partly out of the keyhole,
if on the opposite side of the door from the
key itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>Grasping this little end in a pair of nippers that
held it securely, one of the men easily turned the
key—almost as easily as if he had been on the other
side of the door using his fingers to twist the
opener in the manner intended by law for it to turn.</p>

<p class='c007'>As the back door of the deacon’s house softly
and slowly swung open, two men, wearing masks,
quietly entered. And then one of them, as he
reached in his pocket for an electric flash lamp,
knocked against a chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep still! What’s the matter with you, Denton,
banging about in that way?” demanded the
other of the men in a fierce whisper, which, however,
was a most guarded whisper. The sound
of it did not carry two feet. “What are you doing,
anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I couldn’t help it,” answered Denton. “How
was I to know, Jake, that the confounded chair
was in the road?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You ought to be able to see in the dark,” was
the retort. “You’ve been up to enough shady
work of late.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No more than you!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The reply came sharply. The men were on the
verge of a quarrel, and at a time when they needed
to work in harmony. All this had passed in a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>second, the echo of the noise made by the chair
hardly having had time to die away.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come, this won’t do—scrapping,” remarked
Harrison, in more conciliatory tones. “We’ve got
to get busy. Listen and see if you think that racket
roused him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The men stood still in the darkness, tensely
waiting. They did not hear a sound. They did
not hear Joe open the front door, close it and run
away. This was because they were at the very
back of the house, and also because Joe moved
very softly. Thinking, as he did, that the deacon
had awakened and was coming after him, Joe determined
not to betray himself by any sound.</p>

<p class='c007'>So, having made a noise themselves, the intruders,
listening to determine if it had roused the
inmates, did not hear Joe’s escape.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess it’s all right,” came from Denton, still
whispering.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We can’t afford to take chances on guessing,”
was the remark of his companion. “We’ve got to
make sure. We can’t risk being caught, for what
we’re going to do is a state-prison offense.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How? It is? We’re only taking what we have
at least half a right to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind! Wait until we get through.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re not going to do anything desperate, are
you?” asked Denton, and he seemed to fear his
bolder and rasher companion.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>“Keep still. You’ll see,” was the reply. “Listen
for a sound. If we don’t hear any in three minutes
we’ll go on and do the job.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The men waited, tense, silent and anxious, standing
there in the darkness, ready to run at the slightest
sound. But none came. The noise made by one
of them in the collision with the chair, seemed not
to have aroused any one in the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, come on,” whispered Harrison. “You
know where he keeps the papers, don’t you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. In his desk. It’s in what he calls the
‘back parlor.’ I was in there a couple of times
when we were putting the deal through, and I
know the very drawer he keeps the papers in. That
is, if he hasn’t taken them out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I don’t think he has, Burke.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He might have, Jake. You put it on a bit
strong this afternoon, telling him we’d get the best
of him anyhow. He may be expecting something
like this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never! He thinks we’ve given up. But of
course we won’t!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should say not! We need those papers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and we need cash, too!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re not going to do that are you—rob him
of money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Burke Denton seemed much alarmed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, keep still and come on,” roughly ordered
the other. “We are chinning away here like a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>couple of women. There’s work to be done.
Everybody’s asleep, it’s perfectly safe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where does that lad sleep—Blackford’s son?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Upstairs on the top floor, I think. But he
isn’t Blackford’s son—only adopted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Think he’ll make any trouble?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. We can take care of him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Joe Strong was then too far off to make any
trouble for the intruders. They were now cautiously
moving through the house, one of them
occasionally flashing a beam from his electric torch
to show the way through the rooms.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s the back parlor,” announced Denton,
who seemed to know the plan of the house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right! Now we’ll get busy,” whispered his
companion. “Get out your keys. We may have
to try a lot of ’em before we find one that fits.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I sure hope we do find one,” murmured
Denton. “I don’t want to have to force open the
desk. It makes too much noise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re right there.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The two criminals seemed on better terms now,
and were working in harmony. Advancing by the
intermittent flashes of the electric torch, they approached
a large, old-fashioned desk where Deacon
Blackford kept books, papers and many other
things, partly connected with his business, and
partly with his home life.</p>

<p class='c007'>The desk was one of those old-fashioned ones,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>with an upper part made in the form of a bookcase,
with two glass doors. Below this was a sort
of flap, that could be let down. This formed a
writing table, and when the flap was down it disclosed
rows of pigeonholes, small drawers and compartments
for books and papers. Still below this
section, and on either side of a hollowed-out place,
were more drawers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on, get busy!” directed Harrison. “You’re
better at opening desks than I am. Get out your
keys. I’ll hold the torch.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Denton passed the flashing torch over, and while
his companion held it, having slipped the switch
to a permanent place, so that there was a steady
beam of light, the man with the keys proceeded to
try one after another in the keyhole of the desk.
He was attempting to lower the writing flap, to
come to the compartments and drawers inside.</p>

<p class='c007'>Key after key he tried, making none but the
slightest sounds. But the lock did not give.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Guess we’ll have to jimmy it after all,” said
Denton. “Hold the light nearer, can’t you? Can’t
see a thing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The light’s as near as I can get it, and not be
in your way,” was the retort. “Oh, look! Hang
it all! the battery’s giving out!”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke the light quickly began to fade
from a bright, white glow of the tungsten filament
to a dull yellow. From this it became only a little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>red streak, and the two men were suddenly left in
darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is a nice pickle!” said Harrison, angrily.
“Why didn’t you put in a fresh battery?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I did. You must have been flashing it too
often.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go on! This is the first time I’ve held the light
to-night. It’s all your fault! Now we’ve either
got to call it off or work by the use of matches.
We can’t see to get the right papers in the dark.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wait a minute. I have a scheme,” suggested
Denton. “I saw a lamp on the table right here.
I’ll light that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it’s got any oil in it,” half-sneered Harrison.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, they keep their lamps filled I reckon. Stand
still now, and I’ll light it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Denton struck a match, found the lamp and
presently had the wick aglow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Turn it down, you chump!” hoarsely whispered
Harrison. “That can be seen from outside.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Denton lowered the wick until the light was
dim, but even then it was better to work by than
had been the electric torch, for the illumination
was more diffused.</p>

<p class='c007'>Denton went to work with the keys again, and
luck seemed to be with him, for after two trials
the desk was opened. It was the work of but a
few minutes for the men to sort over the papers
and pick out those they wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>“Now we’ve got ’em!” exclaimed Denton. “I
guess he’ll talk business to us now!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We won’t bother to talk business, now we’ve
got what we want,” answered Harrison. “We’ll
just light out. But before we go we might as well
have this. No use passing up a chance like this.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He reached over his companion’s shoulder and
took a roll of bills from a drawer that had
been opened in the course of the search for the
papers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’re not going to take that, are you?” asked
Denton. “Why, we’ve got the papers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes; and we’re going to have some money, too.
I told the deacon we’d get even with him, and I’m
doing it. This will come in handy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He pocketed the money. The other shook his
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s wrong!” he said. “It’s risky, too. We
ought to be satisfied with the papers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe you are, but I’m not. I’ll take all the
cash I can lay my hands on. And while we’re
here we might as well see if there’s any more.
There’s a clock over there. Lots of country folks
stick bills in clocks. I’m going to have a look.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Despite the protests of his companion, Harrison
went over to a mantel where stood a large wooden
clock. As he opened the door he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Talk about luck! Here’s another roll. Say,
I’m glad we came!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>“Put that back!” commanded the other. “We
have enough.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never can have enough cash,” chuckled the
other. “This makes the haul worth while. Now
we’ll go!”</p>

<p class='c007'>The talk had been done in whispers, and every
move of the men was a silent one. Denton, who
was not quite such a rascal as Harrison, protested
against taking the money, but in vain.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ve got it, and I’m going to keep it!” was the
last word of Harrison.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it’ll get us into trouble, you see if it
won’t,” declared the more timid of the intruders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If it does, it’ll help us out of trouble, too. I’m
going to keep the money, and you don’t have to
take your share if you don’t want to. Now we’ll
just take another look through the desk, for we
may have missed something, and then——”</p>

<p class='c007'>But what else Harrison was going to propose
was not made manifest, for at that instant Denton
exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep still! I hear a noise!”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no doubt of it. Some one could be
heard coming down the front stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on!” hoarsely whispered Harrison.
“We’ve got to beat it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Denton turned to go out the way they had come
in, by the rear door, but his companion caught him
by the arm.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Not that way!” he whispered in his ear. “We’d
be caught sure! This window—the one by the desk—come
on!”</p>

<p class='c007'>It was the work of but an instant to slip the
catch and raise the window. Harrison jumped out
followed by Denton, and as the latter cleared the
sill his foot knocked the lamp off the desk to the
floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a crash of glass, and as Denton and
Harrison ran off in the darkness they saw a flash
of flame, and they smelled burning kerosene.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that?” asked Harrison, turning for a
swift backward glance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I kicked over the lamp—accidental,” gasped
Denton. “It’s exploded and started a fire. We—we’ll
have to go back and put it out!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Harrison laughed in a low chuckle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Go back nothing!” he whispered fiercely. “Let
it burn!”</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER X<br> <span class='large'>THE SIDE-DOOR PULLMAN</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Joe Strong, unaware of the exciting events that
were taking place in the home of his foster-parents—a
home he had deserted for what, to him, were
good and sufficient reasons—hurried on down the
silent and dark streets of Bedford. It was unusual
in such a small town for any one to be out after
midnight, unless there were some special occasion,
and the young wizard had the place to himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I got out of that all right,” he said, half
aloud, as he stopped, when safely around the corner,
to put on his shoes. “I got away without the
deacon’s seeing me. But he was right after me, and
I didn’t think I made much noise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Let’s see now,” went on our hero, musingly,
as he straightened up after lacing his shoes. “What
had I better do? Say, it’s great to feel free to do
just as one pleases for the first time in years!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe flung up his arms and gazed at the silent,
blinking stars which sprinkled the sky overhead.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sure does feel good to be your own boss! I
can go when I please, and come when I please, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>I don’t have to stand the shame of a beating just
because I burned a suit in saving a man’s life! It
sure is good to be free!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was to learn that it is not all joy and happiness
to be “free,” and to be one’s “own boss,” but,
just at present, he felt only a sense of exultation.</p>

<p class='c007'>“First I’ve got to leave this bundle at Tom’s
house,” thought Joe, as he picked up the suit which
had been loaned him. “I’ll leave it there with a
note that will explain. I wish I could see some of
the boys to bid ’em good-bye, but maybe it’s just
as well not to. They might laugh at me, and I
wouldn’t want that. Some day, when I’m a well-known
magician, I’ll come back and give ’em a
show that will open their eyes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe next picked up his valise. It was rather
heavy, for he had stuffed in it belongings that had
accumulated for years—little mementos and keepsakes
of younger days. He also had in it what
clothes he felt he would need. But Joe did not feel
the weight of his satchel now. It was as light
as a feather to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>And to prove it Joe tossed it up in the air, also
the bundle of Tom’s clothes, and there in the darkness
of midnight, standing in the middle of one of
Bedford’s principal streets, he juggled the objects
in the most approved style, using a small stone he
had picked up for the third piece to make a symmetrical
act.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>“I’ll be able to do some juggling if I have to,
when I want to fill in between tricks,” thought Joe.
“I do hope I can get work in some sort of a show.
Professor Rosello ought to be able to give me a
letter, introducing me to some of his friends in the
business.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, standing here juggling and thinking
about it won’t get me anywhere,” said Joe, in a
sort of stage whisper. “I’d better be moving if
I’m to get a berth in my side-door Pullman,” and
he laughed in a silent fashion at the idea.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe had made up his mind to go to the town of
Lorilard, distant about fifty miles from Bedford,
where Professor Rosello was to give a performance
the next day, and for two or three days following.
This much the magician had told Joe in the interview
at the hotel, when he gave him a list of his
stopping places.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I’ll go to see the professor at Lorilard,” decided
Joe. “He can’t any more than turn me
down. But he promised to help me, and he was
grateful to me. I believe he’ll be able to do something.”
Now for Tom’s house, and then my
‘berth!’”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe had made up his mind to take the midnight
freight that stopped at Bedford, and which arrived
in Lorilard some time in the early morning.
Joe was not particular as to time.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to save what money I have,” thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>the boy, “so I won’t have any to waste on railroad
fare. A freight car will suit me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe Strong walked on through the dark and silent
streets. He kept on the grass as much as possible,
for his footsteps rang out loudly in the quietness,
and Joe knew that “Hen” Sylvester and Tim Donovan,
the two policemen of Bedford, did not spend
quite all the night in sleep.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I just wouldn’t like ’em to see me going away
like this,” thought Joe. “They’d be sure to stop
and ask me questions. And if I make too much
noise walking on the sidewalks they may hear me.
It’s me for the green grass.”</p>

<p class='c007'>And so he went on until he came to the Simpson
house. Joe there came to a pause, and looked at the
dwelling. No light showed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Guess they’re all asleep,” he mused. “I wouldn’t
want any of the family to see me sneaking up and
leaving a bundle on the steps. They might take me
for a burglar, and raise a row.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Silently and cautiously he opened the front gate,
and tiptoed up the brick walk, leaving his valise
outside. He laid the suit of clothes, with a little
note he had written, in plain view on the door-step,
and then with a whispered good-bye to Tom, which
that sound-sleeping lad did not hear, Joe set off
again.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I’m really on my way,” he told himself.
“The whole world lies before me, as we used to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>see in our school readers, and I have my own
fortune to make. And I hope I begin to make it
soon,” mused the lad, whimsically. “At least I
hope Dame Fortune allows me to draw a few dollars
a week in advance.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Joe turned into a street that led to the freight
station and caught sight of what was left standing
of the fireworks factory, he could but think of the
stirring events in which he had played such a
prominent part—the discussion with his chums of
the professor’s tricks, the alarm of the explosion,
the swimming of the creek, and the sensational
rescue of Professor Rosello.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no sign of the fire as Joe passed the
scene of it now. It had all died out, and the main
building was surrounded by heaps of ashes which
marked where the smaller structures had stood.</p>

<p class='c007'>Two loud, shrill whistles broke the midnight
stillness.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The freight!” cried Joe, breaking into a run.
“She’s getting ready to leave! I wonder if I can
make it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s leaving ahead of time,” Joe went on. The
freight arrived in Bedford at midnight and left
an hour later, an event which Joe had counted on
in making his calculations to leave by it. But the
train was getting ready to pull out now, fully
twenty minutes early, the two whistles Joe heard
being the signal for “off brakes;” though with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>modern air apparatus this was really only a starting
signal, the brakemen being no longer required to
run along the tops of the cars to loosen the wheels.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll have to hustle!” Joe told himself, as he
increased his pace.</p>

<p class='c007'>The youth was in fine physical condition, and he
knew he could easily reach the freight train before
it passed entirely beyond the station, for it was
a long one.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But I counted on having time to pick out a car,”
thought Joe, still running toward the railroad. “I
wonder what I can do now?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The matter worried him. It is not easy to “jump”
a moving freight train. There are no cars with
steps, such as passenger coaches have, with convenient
hand rails. Jumping a moving freight
train is a risky matter, even for a trained railroad
brakeman.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And how I’m to do it with this valise I don’t
know,” thought Joe. “But it’s got to be done!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was glad he was in such good physical trim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see what the trouble is,” Joe went on. “There
wasn’t any shipment of fireworks to-night, and
that’s why the freight pulled out earlier. I didn’t
think of that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he ran on down the street he heard a voice
behind him calling:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here! Hold on! Stop! Who are you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hen Sylvester!” gasped Joe. “He’s seen me
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>and he’s suspicious. Well, I’ve no time to stop and
explain now. I’d miss the train sure!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He ran on, faster than before. He heard the
patter of feet behind him, and again the hail:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hold on, or I’ll shoot!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’ll only shoot in the air if he does,” Joe told
himself. “I’ll take a chance. I guess he doesn’t
know who I am.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He was near the freight depot now. Another
few steps and he was on the long covered platform
along which the train was moving. None of the
trainmen or depot freight handlers were in sight.
It was a “light” night, and they had gotten through
early.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe watched the train gliding along in front of
him, rapidly acquiring speed. The platform was
on a level with the floor of the freight cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I could only see one with an open door,”
mused Joe. “Then I could dive into it. I don’t
dare take a chance of jumping in between two cars.
I might slip down between the buffers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Eagerly he watched the gliding train. Oh, for
an open door!</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe heard other feet now pounding along the
wooden platform.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s Hen coming to see who I am!” thought Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked for a hiding place. And yet to hide
meant to lose the chance of taking the freight out
of town.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>“I saw him come up here!” some one said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll get him,” said another. “He’s probably
a burglar!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tim Donovan is with Hen now,” thought Joe.
“They’re both after me—the whole Bedford police
force,” and in spite of his predicament he chuckled.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just then there glided past him a freight car with
a wide open door.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s my chance!” cried Joe half aloud. And
the next second he made a flying leap into the moving
“side-door Pullman.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe Strong was on his way—whither?</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XI<br> <span class='large'>A SURPRISED DEACON</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Deacon Blackford had certainly heard a noise.
It was not the slight sound made by Joe Strong,
when that young magician made his escape from
the house, but it was the louder noise made by the
two rascals in taking the papers and money.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What’s that, Amos?” asked Mrs. Abigail Blackford,
as she too heard the suspicious sound.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know,” he answered sleepily enough.
He had lain awake the early part of the night, tossing
restlessly, for the memory of the scene in the
afternoon with the two men had bothered the
deacon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But, Amos,” persisted his wife, “it <i>is</i> a noise.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” he admitted, after listening a moment, “it
surely is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hadn’t you better get up and see what it is?”
she suggested.</p>

<p class='c007'>He waited a moment before replying, meanwhile
listening intently. The sound was plainer now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Couldn’t be cats, could it?” the deacon asked,
and his voice was hopeful. He did not like to get
up, for he was tired and sleepy.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>“Cats! No, the idea!” his wife exclaimed. “It’s
somebody downstairs inside the house, Amos, and
you’ve got to get up and see who it is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Queer time for anybody to be calling,” grumbled
Joe’s foster-father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Calling! It isn’t anybody calling!” exclaimed
Mrs. Blackford in a shrill whisper. “It’s burglars
if it’s anybody. Get up, Amos, and drive ’em out.
Call Joe to help you. He’s good and strong. He
can handle almost as much as you can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But without waiting to call Joe, Mr. Blackford
gave a jump out of bed and hurried down the stairs
in the darkness. As he went down he became
aware of a light in the back parlor—the room
where stood his desk, which was like a safe to him,
and the old clock where his wife insisted on keeping
her small roll of bills, on the theory that
burglars would never think of money being in a
clock.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is some one,” muttered the deacon. “I’m
glad I got up.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He hurried on, taking no pains to muffle the
“clap-clap” of the heels of his slippers, into which
he had hurriedly thrust his feet. “Clap-clap” they
went, down the stairs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as he reached the door of the back parlor
the deacon saw a form disappearing through the
window. Who it was he could not see, as just
then the heel of the person making an egress in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>this queer fashion hit and knocked over the lamp,
which exploded with a slight noise, the burning oil
setting fire to the carpet and the lace curtains.</p>

<p class='c007'>For the moment the fear of fire was uppermost
in the mind of the deacon. He saw the stream of
blazing oil spreading, and he knew that in a
few moments more the whole room would be
ablaze.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the deacon was quick, and, fortunately did
not lose his presence of mind. He caught up a
heavy rug, and, not going near enough the blaze
to let his own thin night garments catch, he tossed
the rug over the blaze, smothering it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then with a quick motion he tore down the
burning lace curtains, and tossed them out of the
open window, where they could harmlessly consume
themselves on the grass. The deacon burned
his hands slightly in pulling down the curtains,
but he did not notice that in the excitement of the
moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>The fire was out almost as soon as it had started,
for he had tossed the rug over burning lamp and
all, and now only some dense black smoke remained
to tell what had happened.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Whew!” panted the deacon, “that was a close
call! It’s a good thing I got up when I did, or the
whole house would have gone! A narrow shave!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He got a pail of water to toss on the smouldering
carpet. After he had lifted the smothering rug,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>and as he doused out the few remaining sparks his
wife called to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Anybody down there, Amos?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, nobody now,” grimly answered the old
man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it smells like some one was smoking down
there. I smell smoke, Amos. There <i>must</i> be somebody
there!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No! They’ve gone,” he answered. “It was
the lamp you smelled smoking. It blew up!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Blew up! Deacon Blackford what ails you?
What’s happened, anyhow?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t rightly know yet, myself. Seems quite
considerable must have happened, and it might
have been worse. You can come down if you want
to. There’s nobody here now but me, and the fire’s
out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The fire’s out!” cried his wife from the head of
the stairs. “What fire? Who started the fire?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come down and you’ll see it all,” he answered,
looking about to make sure there were no stray
sparks anywhere.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Blackford lost no time in descending, and
her surprise was as great as was the deacon’s. But
it was the loss of her curtains, the burned hole in
the carpet, the broken lamp and the charred rug
that surprised Joe’s foster-mother. She had not
seen the intruder go out of the window, as had her
husband.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>“What in the world—how did it—who——?”
she began, hardly knowing what question to ask
first. But the deacon cut in with:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know any more about it than you do.
I came down in time to see somebody go through
the window and kick over the lamp. Then the fire
started and I had to hustle to put it out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some one went through the window! Who in
the world could it have been? Did you speak to
him?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Burglars don’t generally leave a card, nor stop
to talk,” answered the old man grimly. “But I
guess——”</p>

<p class='c007'>The deacon did not finish, but crossed the room
to his desk. He noticed that the flap was down,
and he knew he had closed and locked it the night
before. Hurriedly he ran through his papers, and
then straightened up with a queer look on his face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’re gone!” he gasped. “Gone!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?” asked his wife. “What’s gone?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My investment papers—the securities—the
only thing I had to show what money was due
me. They’re gone and whoever has ’em can make
use of ’em! I’ve been robbed!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Turning again to the desk he opened a small
drawer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He took the money too!” he muttered. “Every
cent of it, and there was nigh on to a hundred dollars
there!”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>He fairly moaned out the words, and putting
his hand to his head sank weakly into a chair. Mrs.
Blackford regarded her husband pityingly and
darted toward him, fearing he was going to faint,
though he had never done it in his life. Then a
sudden idea came to her.</p>

<p class='c007'>She rushed over to the clock, opened it and fell
back, raising her hands in the air in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mine’s gone too!” she cried! “The thirty-nine
dollars I had in the clock! The burglar took that
too! Oh, this is terrible! You must call the constables,
Amos! We’ve been robbed! They took
my money! Call Joe, and send him after Hen
Sylvester. I’ll call him,” for the deacon seemed
incapable of action just then.</p>

<p class='c007'>Mrs. Blackford hurried upstairs, and called:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joe! Joe! Get up! There’ve been burglars
in the house! They’ve robbed your pa and me, and
set fire to the place! Get up and go for the constables!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is he coming?” asked the deacon, whose heart
was not beating quite so fast now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can’t seem to make him hear,” said Mrs.
Blackford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll rout him out,” said the old man. “I guess
he’d better go after the constable. He can go
quicker than I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But Joe did not answer to this summons either,
and when the door of his room was opened, showing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>his undisturbed bed, and when a quick search
revealed that he had taken most of his belongings
the deacon jumped to the most natural conclusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s gone, Abigail!” he cried. “Joe’s run away,
and it was him that robbed us and set fire to the
place!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, Deacon! <i>He</i> wouldn’t do such a thing!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Woman, I tell you he did!” cried the deacon
in his most thundering tones. “He’s robbed us and
run away! I’ll get the law after him! The thief!”
and with a face flushed with wrath the deacon proceeded
to dress, muttering the while:</p>

<p class='c007'>“He robbed us! Joe robbed us and ran away!
I always knew that the circus and magician blood
in him would tell! Now it’s come out with a
vengeance!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XII<br> <span class='large'>THE PROFESSOR’S ASSISTANT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Joe Strong slid half-way across the “side-door
Pullman,” as he had called the freight car into
which he had jumped from the station platform.
One cause for his sliding was the force of his jump,
the momentum carrying him. Another reason was
because the floor of the car was covered with bits
of dried hay, which is always slippery.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A hay car!” exclaimed Joe, as his nose caught
the odor that was so familiar to him. “Been loaded
with baled hay. I’m glad I struck something as
clean as that. Might just as well have jumped into
a car that had been filled with fertilizer, or something
else not nice to smell all night. Yes, I guess
I’m in luck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The train was now swinging along at a good
pace, and Joe proceeded to make himself comfortable
for his long ride which, at best, was not going
to be any too easy for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>The youth chuckled to himself as he thought of
the two town policemen vainly seeking him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s another time I gave Hen Sylvester the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>slip,” murmured Joe with a smile in the darkness.</p>

<p class='c007'>Though the hay car had been unloaded there still
remained on the floor a quantity of the fodder.
With his feet Joe made this into a pile in one corner,
and there he intended to lie down to get some sleep
if he could. The night was warm, and he needed
no covering. But he slid the door partly shut to
keep out some of the dirt and cinders.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This isn’t going to improve the appearance of
my clothes—sleeping in ’em,” he mused. “Guess
I’ll take off my coat and vest. I can save them
a little that way, anyhow.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Joe stretched out on his improvised bed
and drew a long breath.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, so far so good,” he told himself. “I’m
on my way. Now the rest is up to Professor
Rosello. I’ll see him in the morning.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe did not easily go to sleep, though he was
tired. He had a burden on his mind, and he was
not a little worried.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder what the deacon will think when he
wakes up and finds me gone?” thought Joe. “I
guess it will surprise him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>If Joe only knew!</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally drowsiness came, and he slumbered
through the rest of the night. The train rattled
on, stopping now and then at stations to pick up or
leave freight, but Joe knew nothing of this. He
had thought that perhaps he might be put off the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>car by some brakeman, but he decided he must
take chances on this. And, as it happened, he was
not disturbed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was awakened by the sudden jolting stop of
the train, and, as he opened his eyes he saw, through
the partly shut door, that the sun was brightly
shining.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-morning—morning!” cried the lad. “I
wonder what you have up your sleeve for me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>Though he tried to be jolly with himself, he
was not in very good shape for joking. He was
lame and stiff from sleeping on the hay-bed, and he
felt the need of washing, as any one does, even
if he travels in a real Pullman. Then, too, he was
hungry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Wonder if we hit anything then?” Joe asked
himself, for the train seemed to have stopped
with unusual suddenness. “Guess I’ll take a look
out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He peered from the door, and saw that the train
was in a large railroad yard. On several adjoining
tracks were lines of freight cars, and, as Joe looked
out, he saw the engine that had been pulling his
train going off toward the round house.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This must be Lorilard,” thought Joe. “It’s the
end of the run. That bump must have been some
other cars they switched on to the end of this train.
Well, I’ve arrived, it seems. Now to get busy, find
the professor and——But first I guess I’d better
<span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>get a wash and have something to eat,” he reflected.
“I can’t look very presentable.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe put on his vest and coat, picked up his valise
and was about to jump down out of the freight
car into the yard, when he saw a trainman approaching.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d better wait until he passes,” Joe thought.
“He might make it hot for me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is a law against unauthorized persons riding
on freight trains, and though some brakemen
often let tramps and other persons “steal” a ride,
still most railroad men are not as lenient, and not
infrequently throw off, or “beat-up,” those who
“ride the brake-rods,” or crawl into the empty
cars.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe drew back, but the man did not pass on. Instead
he busied himself tacking up shipping cards
on several cars near the one Joe was in.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish he’d go!” reflected our hero. “I want
to get out. I’m almost starved.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Finally the man moved farther down the track,
and Joe took this chance to emerge. He dropped to
the ground, but, unluckily, just then the yard-master,
for he it was, turned and saw the young
wizard.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here, you!” he roared. “What do you mean?
Stealing a ride? I’ll fix you!” and he started to
run after Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Joe was a good sprinter, and, though he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>rather stiff from his uncomfortable bed, he was
more than a match for the yard-master. Seeing
that the “tramp,” as he supposed him to be, was distancing
him, the man caught up an iron coupling
pin and threw it at Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>If it had hit the youth it might have hurt him
badly, but the yard-master’s aim was no better than
his running, and Joe was soon safely out of his
reach. There came a break in the line of freight
cars, and Joe slipped through this, thus getting out
of sight.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I’d better stop running, I reckon,” he
thought, “or some other trainman may think it suspicious
to see me in such a hurry.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He slowed down to a walk, and presently
emerged from the yard into a street.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will you kindly direct me to a hotel?” asked
Joe of the first man he met. “I’m a stranger in
town. I don’t want an expensive place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s the Railroad House, just down at the
foot of this street,” the man said, looking at Joe
curiously. “I can’t recommend it, though it’s cheap
enough. Then there’s the Boswell, three blocks up
that way and two over,” and he indicated the directions.
“I stop there myself. It’s good and not
expensive.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thank you,” Joe said. “I’ll try that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just get in?” asked the man, and he smiled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” answered the young magician. “My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>special car was just switched off for me!” and he
laughed as he turned away.</p>

<p class='c007'>He found the Boswell to be just about the kind
of hotel that came within his limited means. He
did not want to engage a room until after he had
seen Professor Rosello, and he was not sure where
the magician was stopping. But he could easily
inquire.</p>

<p class='c007'>The hotel clerk was friendly, and agreed to look
after Joe’s valise while our hero had breakfast.
Joe indulged in a good wash and ate a hearty
meal.</p>

<p class='c007'>On inquiry at the hotel desk when he claimed his
satchel, he found that the professor was going to
give a performance that night. The clerk did not
know where Professor Rosello was staying, but
Joe thought he could find out by inquiring at the
Opera House, as the local amusement place was
called.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Joe made his way thither he saw, posted in
various parts of the town, large announcements of
the “world-wide famous and renowned magician,
prestidigitator and sleight-of-hand artist, Professor
Alonzo Rosello.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s the one I’m looking for all right,” thought
Joe. “Now to see what’s doing.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He inquired his way to the Opera House and
entered the lobby. There was no one in the ticket
office, for it was early yet.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>A woman was scrubbing the oilcloth on the floor
of the entrance.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is Professor Rosello about?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s he?” inquired the woman, who appeared
to be slightly deaf, if her loud tones counted for
anything.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s the prestidigitator—the magician——”</p>

<p class='c007'>The old woman shook her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know none of them foreign languages,”
she said. “You’ll have to speak plain English.
And my name ain’t Maggie, neither.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t say Maggie—I said magician,” and Joe
spoke louder. “I’m looking for Professor Rosello.
Him!” he exclaimed, as he saw, hanging on the
wall one of the magician’s bills, containing what
was supposed to be a likeness of him in evening
clothes, with a little red imp whispering secrets in
his ear.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, him! That feller what does tricks? He’s
back on the stage,” said the old woman, resuming
her scrubbing.</p>

<p class='c007'>Taking this as an invitation to go back, Joe made
his way to the rear of the theatre. There was a
single light on the stage, and Joe could see the
professor moving about, arranging some of his
apparatus in anticipation of the evening’s performance.
And Joe heard the magician talking
loudly, and as if very much disturbed about something.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>“It couldn’t have happened at a much worse
time!” exclaimed the professor. “I don’t see what
possessed him to run away and leave me just when
I needed him. I don’t know what I’m to do. I’ll
have to omit some of my best illusions! It’s too
bad!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe kept on down the aisle, and, passing through
one of the boxes, reached the stage, which was not
yet “set” for the performance.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then saw Professor Rosello talking to a stage-hand,
and went over to speak to him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, what is it?” asked the professor, not
recognizing Joe, for the place was dark.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Don’t you remember me?” our hero questioned.
“I’m Joe Strong who——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well met! Say, but I <i>am</i> glad to see you!”
cried the magician, heartily. “Perhaps you’re just
the very one who can help me out!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll be very glad if I can,” said Joe. “I
came to you to ask you to help me. I want a place
where I can earn my living. I’ve run away from
home, and I’m going to learn to be a magician.
I thought perhaps——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Tell me the details later!” cut in the professor.
“I’m in a peck of trouble now. My assistant, whom
I always have with me when I play in the larger
towns, left me in a fit of anger, and just when I
needed him most. He wanted more money than I
could afford to pay, and I’m left in the lurch. Now
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>you know something about illusions, so, perhaps,
with a little coaching, you can help me out. Will
you do it?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Will I?” Joe cried. “Just give me the chance!
It’s what I’ve been hoping for all along!”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIII<br> <span class='large'>JOE’S HELP NEEDED</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Joe could hardly believe his good luck. When
he decided to run away he had no settled plans in
mind. All he expected to do was to seek out Professor
Rosello, and ask him what would be the best
means of starting in on the chosen career. But
to be engaged without any delay as an assistant was
beyond Joe’s wildest hopes.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had come about by a curious trick of fate, and
Joe was very much pleased.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you really mean it?” he asked the professor,
as they stood on the dimly lighted stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Mean it? Of course I do. My assistant who
was to help me with to-night’s performance suddenly
left, and I didn’t know what to do.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As soon as I recognized you, I remembered that
you had some knowledge of our way of doing
things. Then, too, as I told you before, you have
in you naturally, and because of practice, the makings
of a magician. So I think you can very easily
fill the shoes of my late assistant. He was clever,
but not reliable. Of course I can not pay you much
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>money. I will begin on ten dollars a week, and
I’ll pay all your expenses. Later on, if you do well,
as I’m sure you will, I’ll increase the amount, for
you may be able to help me do more elaborate
tricks, and so we will draw better houses. Does
that satisfy you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed it does!” cried Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>This was luck in truth, for this, too, was more
than he had hoped for. He would have been glad
to work with the professor to earn merely his expenses
for a while, until he learned something of
the inside workings of magic.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now,” said Professor Rosello, “we’ll have to do
some quick work, Joe. I’ll call you that, for I feel
as if I had known you a long time. I’ll never forget
how you saved my life, and you will never
want a friend as long as I am alive. Where are
you stopping?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No place, just at present,” replied Joe. “I came
in on a freight train, after I ran away from home,
and I looked you up as soon as I could after I had
breakfast.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Joe told the story of how he had left the
home of his foster-parents.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had better put up at my hotel,” said the
professor. “I’m stopping at a boarding house. It’s
better for me than a regular hotel. I can get you a
room there. I had planned to give a three nights’
show here, but when my assistant left I thought I’d
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>have to cut it down to one. Now I’ll go ahead as
originally planned, thanks to you.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now suppose we just run over what I do in
the evening’s performance, so you’ll know what is
expected of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Rosello hastily described to Joe the
program—how he came out on the stage, rolling
in his hands a red handkerchief, which he caused
suddenly to vanish. Of course this was done by
“palming.” While palming the handkerchief, which
thus seemed to vanish into air, the professor
would keep up a “patter,” or running line of
talk, concerning the tricks he was to show that
night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you know,” said the professor to
Joe, “that we have to depend on outside aid in doing
what the public calls ‘tricks.’ That is, we have
as our three main helpers, the table, the wand and
the clothes we wear. I need not tell the son of
Professor Morretti that the evening dress of a
modern magician has in it many hiding places—<i>pochettes</i>,
the French call them. They are secret
pockets, placed where the performer finds he has
best use for them. Into these pockets a borrowed
watch, ring, handkerchief—anything not too large,
in fact—may be concealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course we bring the hidden things out at
the proper time. But, as I say, the dress of a
magician is important. I haven’t time to get you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>one, and my assistant took his away with him, so
you won’t be able to do much for me in that line.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Another great aid to us is our wand. From
time immemorial a wand has been the symbol of
magic. Ordinarily it is but a stick, a bit of ebony
or ivory, and of course with that it is not possible
to do any tricks. But the wand is valuable in that
you can wave it in the air, or before a person’s
face. Naturally their eyes follow the motion of
the wand, their attention is taken from your other
hand, in which you may have palmed, or concealed,
something. And while their eyes are thus off that
hand you can get rid of the palmed article, or put
it in the place where you wish it next to appear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I have read of that in some books treating
of magic,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The books don’t tell you everything,” said the
professor with a smile, “but of course they are
valuable. I want to tell you that nowadays we have
two wands, instead of one. One is an ordinary
piece of ebony, solid, and not prepared in any way.
Then we have a combined hollow wand, in one end
of which is concealed a small pistol, so that by a
mere pressure on a spring, which is all but invisible,
we can produce a shot. On the other end of the
wand is a concealed claw and spring, so that I can
draw into the hollow a silk handkerchief or light
piece of cloth, making it disappear before the very
eyes of the audience. Of course the substitution of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the trick wand for the solid one must be made
unseen by the audience.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I should think so,” commented Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The tall hat is another great aid to us who
work in magic,” went on the professor. “But of
late years it is hard to borrow one in an ordinary
audience, so I don’t often use it. Years ago,
when more men wore tall, silk hats, it was easy
to borrow one from somebody in the audience, and
do all sorts of tricks with it—or, rather, with one
of my own which I substituted unseen. My hat,
of course, was made for my purpose. It had secret
compartments in it and the lining being black, they
did not show when I held it up to show that, apparently,
it was empty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I might state, Joe, that of course nothing ever
comes out of a tall hat, or any other kind of a
hat, my own, or that of any one else, unless it has
first been put there. ‘Loaded’ is the term we
use. That is to say, I must first put into the hat
a live rabbit, a cannon ball, a piece of cheese, an
egg—anything, in fact, that I wish to produce I
must first put in the prepared hat. Then I can
bring it out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So much for the hat. Only, as I said, tall hats
are rather hard to borrow, so I often work with an
ordinary derby, having one of my own made with
a secret compartment. Only it has to be small, as
derbies haven’t much spare space.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>“It would be great if we could work with a
straw hat—especially if we gave a show in summer!”
exclaimed Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, it would, yes. I never thought of that!”
exclaimed Professor Rosello. “I believe we could
have a trick straw hat made. Say, Joe, I’m glad
to see you taking an interest this way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’m going to be a magician!” cried the
youth. “I want to find out all I can about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s too bad your father didn’t live to tell you
about his tricks,” said the magician. “He was a
real artist, while the most of us are but imitators.
However, it can’t be helped. I will teach you all
I know if you want to learn.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I surely do!” murmured the boy.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now to finish my little preliminary talk,” went
on the sleight-of-hand artist, “I will mention the
table. That, or in fact several tables or little
stands, are of great aid to a magician. In the
early days the performers used a big table, all
draped about with velvet, and concealed under this
velvet was an assistant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“When the magician wanted to cause an object
to disappear he would place it on the table just
over a hole, which was not in view because it was
hidden by a trap-door. Then he would put a hollow
cone or hollow block over the object, which
would at once drop through the hole in the table,
into the hands of the concealed assistant.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“But as performers became more clever they used
simpler tables. Some, of course, seemed to be
just spindle-legged affairs, but mirrors fitted in
made a place where objects could be concealed,
though it seemed as though the audience could look
right through the legs of the table. But there are
some tables which are not at all mechanical, except
that they have a place at the back for a <i>servante</i>,
or shelf, below the level of the table, and on this
shelf objects can be placed when the performer
has to get rid of them for the time being.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sounds complicated,” murmured Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s simple when you understand it,” said the
professor. “I sometimes use as a <i>servante</i> a little
mesh bag, which I can fasten to the back of a chair—that
is if the back can’t be seen through. Then
of course I have little tables—<i>console</i> tables they
were called in the days of Robert-Houdin.</p>

<p class='c007'>“These tables stand close to the draperies which
are back of the stage, and above the tables is a
slit cut in the curtain, the fall of the draperies concealing
it. Through this slit my assistant can thrust
his hand and take away or substitute certain
articles. That will be part of your work.</p>

<p class='c007'>“So then, with the wand, with a suit having in
it many secret pockets, and with the help of a
<i>servante</i> in one form or another we do most of our
tricks, never forgetting that palming is one vital
need. Of course I have elaborate pieces of apparatus—that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>is elaborate for me, some performers
carry much more than I do. But the tendency in
these days is to get away from big mechanical
effects, since the audience knows there is some
trick about them, even though it can’t be seen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course you know some of what I have
told you, Joe, but I thought it no harm to repeat
it. Now I’ll give you a little drill, and we’ll be
ready for to-night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor told Joe the principal tricks he
proposed performing that night. In comparatively
few of them was Joe’s aid needed, except that he
was to be on the stage to hand the professor articles
when wanted, or to remove them—passive sort of
work.</p>

<p class='c007'>But in one trick—that of making a young man
disappear when seated in a chair on the stage in
full view of the audience—Joe took an active
part.</p>

<p class='c007'>Having gone over as much as he thought necessary,
Professor Rosello took Joe to the boarding
house, where they would stay for at least three
nights. There, too, the magician gave Joe more
instructions, and had him practice some palming
and card tricks. Joe was naturally good at these.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m almost glad my regular assistant failed
me,” the professor said, “for I think you are going
to be better, Joe. You have a natural aptitude for
learning this art.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>“I’m glad you think so,” remarked the youth,
“for I want very much to perfect myself in it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>That afternoon Joe and the professor went
through several tricks for practice, taking care that
no small boys or other unauthorized persons were
secretly in the theatre to see how the tricks were
done, and so reveal them.</p>

<p class='c007'>The night of the performance came at last, and
Joe went to the Opera House with the professor.
They went back on the stage to see that all was in
readiness for the curtain to rise.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A good house,” remarked Professor Rosello, as
he peered through the peep-hole of the curtain.
“We’ll make a little money to-night, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m glad of it. I wouldn’t want to bring you
bad luck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I think you’ll bring me good luck. Now
we’re ready, I guess.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The curtain went up, the professor came out,
bowing and smiling and making the handkerchief
disappear by cleverly palming it, then slipping it
into one of his secret pockets, afterward seeming
to draw it from the end of his wand. To do this,
of course, he merely palmed it again, and let it
gradually appear as he wished.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he did several stock tricks; one of them being
the bringing forth of a small jar of goldfish
seemingly from a man’s derby hat.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was no trick about the hat. The professor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>went down off the stage and borrowed it,
but, on his way back, while his back was toward
the audience, he slipped into the hat a flat dish
filled with water and live goldfish. This dish Joe
had passed to him a moment before from behind
the scenes, through one of the slits in the curtain.</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor concealed the flat jar of goldfish,
water and all, under his vest, but the dish had
over it a tightly fitting cover, made of a thin sheet
of rubber.</p>

<p class='c007'>As he walked back on to the stage Professor
Rosello slipped the dish into the hat, and, as he
lifted it out, in full view of the audience, he, unseen
by the spectators, snapped off the rubber cover
with his thumb. Thus he seemed to bring out a
jar of fish in real water, and there was no doubt
about the realness of the water, nor the life of the
fish. They could be seen swimming about, and the
professor dipped his hand in the water, sprinkling
it about the stage. Then he passed the hat back to
the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>The goldfish had been purchased in a store that
day, and kept in water until needed, Joe putting
them in the flat dish, and slipping over the rubber
cover just before they were to be used.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now for my next trick,” began Professor
Rosello, “I shall want to borrow a boy or young
man. I don’t want one who has any friends, as
I am going to cause him to disappear, and of course
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>no one wants that to happen to a friend. I am
going to make him totally disappear. Who will
lend me a young man for that purpose?</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come now,” he went on, as there was a pause.
“I see several young ladies here with young men.
Surely one of them can be spared. No? No one
will volunteer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>There were smiles and some laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see a nice young man right here,” the professor
said, coming down the steps, and standing
close to a young girl and her escort. He laid his
hand on the youth’s shoulder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You haven’t any use for him, have you?” he
asked the blushing girl. “May I not make him
disappear?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No!” she laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well, then I must find some one else.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a movement in the back of the house
as if some one intended to volunteer, but, as the
professor did not want this, he forestalled it by
quickly saying:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Never mind. I see you are all afraid. Well, I
will call on my young assistant. He is not of much
use to me, or to the world either, so I will make
him disappear.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This was Joe’s signal to come forward for one of
the more elaborate tricks.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIV<br> <span class='large'>JOE’S DISAPPEARANCE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“You’re not afraid to be made to vanish into
thin air, are you?” asked Professor Rosello of Joe,
that being part of the “patter” of this trick. “You
don’t mind being made to vanish?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” answered Joe, “not if it doesn’t hurt.”
The audience laughed. Joe was getting on surprisingly
well. He had feared he would be stricken
with stage fright on this, his first appearance in
public. But there was not the least sign of it,
though there was a packed house. One reason was
that, of course, the magician occupied the center of
the stage most of the time, and all eyes were focused
on him. Joe had only a minor part as yet.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, also, there must have been something inherited
by him from his parents, who fairly lived
in the public eye. Joe took to it naturally.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see he doesn’t mind in the least,” the professor
said to the audience. “He’ll never be missed,
and if I used some boy from the audience this
might not be the case.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“For this trick,” went on the professor, “I need
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>a young man. I have this—er—useless specimen——”
and he tapped Joe on the shoulder.
There was more laughter from the audience. “I
also need,” proceeded Professor Rosello, “a chair,
a sheet and a piece of paper. They are here,”
and he brought forward a chair, a black cloth and a
sheet of a newspaper. “There is nothing extraordinary
about any of these articles except about
my young assistant. And he will feel most extraordinary
when he starts to vanish into thin air.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The paper, as you can see, is the front page of
your local publication, <cite>The Herald</cite>,” and the performer
held up a sheet of paper. Every one in the
audience could see that it was what it purported to
be—at least on one side, and that was the only side
held up to the crowd in the Opera House.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This sheet of paper I will place on the stage,”
went on the professor, and he suited the action to
the words. “On top of the paper I will place this
chair, on which my young assistant is going to sit,”
and seemingly without any special preparation the
magician set the chair on the paper, one leg being
near each of the four corners of the sheet.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now if you will kindly take your seat in the
chair, we shall proceed,” said Mr. Crabb, otherwise
Professor Rosello. Joe sat down, his heart beating
a little faster than usual, for he wanted the trick
to work perfectly, and much depended on him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-bye,” said the professor with mock
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>solicitude, as he shook hands with Joe. “This is
the last we shall see of you,” and he pretended to
be distressed. Several boys in the gallery shouted
their farewells to Joe in laughing tones. He waved
his hands to the audience, which was curiously expectant.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will now cover my assistant, chair and all with
this sheet,” said the professor. “I do that because
the disappearance of a person sometimes is attended
by painful scenes, and I do not wish to make you
suffer. This sheet was once white,” he went on, as
he shook out a black cloth, turning it about so that
both sides could be seen. There was nothing tricky
about that, it was evident.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It used to be white, but in traveling about the
sheet lost its original color, and, as I do not carry
a laundress with me, it has never been washed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As a matter of fact the cloth had always been
black. It had to be, so the audience could not see
through it to witness the details of the trick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will now cover my assistant in the chair with
this white-black sheet,” continued Professor Rosello,
“and when I raise it he will be—gone!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He draped the cloth over Joe’s head and shoulders,
letting it fall to the floor of the stage on
all sides of the chair. He then took up his “pistol”
wand, which fired a blank shot.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Are you ready?” he called to Joe, after a dramatic
pause.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>“Ready,” was the muffled reply.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then go!” cried the professor. He pointed his
wand at the covered chair, there was a loud report,
and a moment later, when the professor whisked
the black sheet off the chair was empty. The professor
lifted the sheet of paper from under the
chair. Apparently there was not a break in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a gasp of astonishment from the
crowd.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see,” said the professor, bowing and smiling
when the applause had subsided, “he has disappeared—vanished
into thin air. I am glad it happened
to none of you, though of course I might be
able to reincarnate you again, as——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He appeared greatly astonished at the sight of
some one in the back of the theatre.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, look who’s here!” he cried, pointing with
his wand. “My young assistant has not waited for
me to call him back to life. He came of himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The audience turned to behold Joe calmly walking
down the middle aisle, and up the stage by
means of the temporary steps which the professor
used to descend and ascend.</p>

<p class='c007'>There was more applause at Joe’s unexpected appearance
in this fashion, and the trick made a big
hit.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now to let you into the secret.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trick consisted of several parts. A trap-door
was in the stage through which Joe could disappear.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>This trap, directly under the chair and
paper, was operated by a theatre employee, who of
course would not tell, at least beforehand, how the
trick was done. After Joe had gone down through
the trap, into the room that exists under all theatrical
stages, it was an easy matter for him to slip
out through the stage door, run around an alley,
and enter the front of the theatre, to walk calmly
down the aisle.</p>

<p class='c007'>But how could he disappear through the seat of
the chair, and through the sheet of paper, without
making a break, at least in the paper?</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a trick about the paper, although it
seemed to be perfectly ordinary. It was a sheet
from the local paper, but it had been prepared in
advance by the professor. On the back was pasted
a square of cardboard, a quarter of an inch smaller
each way than the trap-door in the stage. This
paper trap, for such it was, was divided in the
middle, the two flaps being hinged to the sheet of
newspaper. The reason the cardboard did not show
when held up to the audience was that the whole
sheet of newspaper was double, one half being
folded over the cardboard trap.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Professor Rosello laid the paper down in
the stage he was guided by certain small marks,
so that it went exactly over the trap in the floor.
This trap was hinged at the back, opening downward,
but kept in place when not in use by a strong
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>iron bar underneath. Next he placed the chair over
the piece of paper, the legs going into exact positions
previously marked on the paper, but the marks
were too small to be seen by the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>The object in placing the paper on the stage was
to get the audience to believe that there was no
hole in the wooden floor through which Joe
could disappear, it being the natural inference that
such was the method used. But when the crowd
saw what they thought was the unbroken sheet of
paper, they would not suppose Joe had gone down
through that, as he really had.</p>

<p class='c007'>The chair was also a trick one. The seat of
it was on hidden hinges so it could be lifted up and
folded back. There were also secret springs on it
which, when released, shot out and extended certain
thin steel projections, which distended the black
sheet into such shape that they made the rough outline
of a person sitting on the chair.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Joe took his seat on the chair, under cover
of the black cloth, he pressed the secret springs, and
a ring appeared above his head to support the black
cloth, exactly as if it were supported by his head.
Other projections appeared at his knees, and as the
bottom of the cloth was arranged by the professor
some distance away from the legs of the chair,
Joe was as if he were under a sort of tent, held
out and away from him, so he could move about
a little without being seen.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>As soon as he was covered, and had worked
the secret springs, he lifted up the false seat of
the chair, supporting himself by his hands on the
framework, into which the seat fitted.</p>

<p class='c007'>This seat Joe carefully folded back, taking care
to make no noise and not to disturb the black cloth
all around him. Meanwhile the professor had with
his foot given a rap on the floor of the stage. This
was a signal to the man below to open the trap in
the floor.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe, hidden under the black cloth, felt for the
opening in the floor with his feet. A stepladder
was hurriedly put into place by the stage-hand, and
Joe lowered himself down through the chair, the
prepared hole in the paper and the hole cut in the
stage, to the ladder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The ladder was quickly taken away, the stage-hand
reached up and lowered the seat of the chair
back in place. Also, when this had been done he
closed the trap-door in the stage, and the newspaper
with its trap was in place above it, seemingly
unbroken.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then the professor fired the shot and whisked
off the black cloth, as he did so touching the secret
springs, so that the projections snapped back out of
sight, and when the cloth was lifted off the chair
looked as it did at first, only Joe was not on it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he came running down the aisle, and persons
who suspected that he had gone down through
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>the stage did not know what to make of the piece
of newspaper. It did not fit their theory.</p>

<p class='c007'>That paper, appeared to be an ordinary sheet, and
no one, or at least very few, would have thought
of a trap being cut in that.</p>

<p class='c007'>And thus was the “disappearing” trick worked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very good! You did splendidly!” said the professor
in a low voice as Joe came up on the stage.
“It went off to perfection!”</p>

<p class='c007'>After Joe made his bow in acknowledgment of
the applause he received for his part in the trick,
he prepared for the next “experiment,” as the professor
often called his acts.</p>

<p class='c007'>That first night of Joe’s assistance went off well,
a number of acts being done after the “disappearance,”
all being well received.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A very satisfactory evening,” remarked Professor
Rosello, as he and Joe went to their boarding
house, after having put away their apparatus.
“I hope we shall do as well the two remaining
nights.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“So do I,” agreed Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>He was very tired, for he had not rested well in
the freight car, but a good night’s sleep made him
feel like a new person.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XV<br> <span class='large'>INVOKING THE LAW</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>While Joe Strong was thus making his first
public appearance as a wizard, or, rather, as a
magician’s assistant, quite different scenes were being
enacted in his home town and at his former
residence.</p>

<p class='c007'>Deacon Blackford had discovered the fire, found
out that he had been robbed, and noted the disappearance
of Joe. With these facts confronting
himself and his wife, the deacon at once began to
act.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What you going to do?” asked Mrs. Blackford,
as he dressed for the street.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m going out,” he answered grimly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! At this time of night?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Can’t help it,” was the reply. “I’m going to
get the law after him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You mean Joe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t mean anybody else! He robbed me and
you, and he’s got to take the consequences! I’m
going to look for the constables. Joe can’t have
gone very far. I saw him jumping out of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>window, but at the time I didn’t know who it was.
He robbed me, and he set fire to the place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But he didn’t mean to do <i>that</i>,” said Mrs. Blackford
defensively. “According to your tell, he accidentally
kicked the lamp with his foot.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Accident or no accident, he did it, and I’m going
to have the law on him! I’ll get the constables.
He’s took a lot of money, and papers worth more.
He may have been in league with those rascals,
Denton and Harrison,” murmured the deacon.
“But, no. I don’t hardly believe that. He didn’t
know them. He just did this out of natural badness.
Couldn’t expect much else from the son of
a circus performer and a worker of the black art.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He spoke harshly and angrily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe there’s <i>some</i> good circus women, and
men too, for that matter, Deacon,” said his wife
softly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, not one—they’re all dishonest!” Mr. Blackford
declared. “But I’ll get the law after Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He made ready for the street, though it was a
most unusual hour for Deacon Blackford to be out.
But the occasion was unusual.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll be back as soon as I can,” he told his wife.</p>

<p class='c007'>Out into the night went the deacon, his brain
rather in a whirl over the recent events. He walked
down the silent streets, his footsteps echoing loudly.
He headed for the center of the town where the
police station was located, for the two constables
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>reported at this place once or twice during the
night.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hen Sylvester and Tim Donovan had been having
adventures of their own in chasing Joe. But
they had missed him, and when they saw him fling
himself, rather rashly, into the open freight car,
which quickly bore him away from them, they
turned back much chagrined.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He got away!” exclaimed Hen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s what he did,” agreed his companion officer.
“I wonder who he was? I wish we could
have caught him. He was a burglar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” chimed in Hen. “Now we’ll have
to go back to town, and find out who was
robbed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Back to the police station went the two constables,
panting somewhat after their fruitless run.
They reached the lockup about the same time
Deacon Blackford did. There were no prisoners in
the jail then, so the services of a watchman were
temporarily dispensed with.</p>

<p class='c007'>Hen and Tim saw a figure walking along the
street near the little building that contained a few
cells. Their previous experience had made them
suspicious of any one abroad at this hour.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s another one of ’em!” exclaimed Hen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Another who?” asked his fellow officer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Burglar. We’ll get him. Come on!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Determined that this second midnight prowler
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>should not get away the two constables made a rush
for him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ve got you!” cried Hen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Surrender!” yelled Tim, drawing his revolver.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here! Let me go! What does this mean?”
cried Joe’s foster-father.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the sound of his voice the two constables
released their holds and stepped back.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Deacon Blackford!” they gasped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s who I am,” was the response. “But
what does this mean?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We—we took you for a burglar,” explained
Hen. “We chased one a while ago, and missed
him, and we were suspicious when we saw you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you doing out so late?” asked Tim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I came to report a robbery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where?” asked both officers eagerly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“At my house. I’ve been robbed of some money
and valuable papers. Some of my wife’s money
was also taken.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What did I tell you!” wailed Hen Sylvester.
“I knew that burglar who got away took something!
If we had only caught him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you see him?” quickly inquired the deacon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but we couldn’t see his face—couldn’t tell
who he was,” explained Tim.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I can tell you who he was!” announced the
deacon, importantly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You?” gasped both constables.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>“Yes! He was Joe Strong!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joe Strong? What! Not your——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“My foster-son,” broke in the deacon. “I regret
to say that he has run away with money and valuable
papers belonging to me. I want him arrested.
I’ll swear out a warrant in the morning. But if you
look for him now you may find him. Arrest him
on sight!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No use looking now,” said Hen, despondently.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because he took the midnight freight. We saw
him jump into an empty car as the train was pulling
out of the station. I knew he must have been up
to some mischief, or he wouldn’t have run the way
he did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Tim and Hen, by turns, told of their fruitless
chase after Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We didn’t know who he was until you told
us,” said Hen to the deacon, “but we suspected he
was a burglar. Did he get much?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The deacon told the details of the robbery, the
fire and its extinguishment, and how he had set
out to invoke the law on his runaway foster-son.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I want him arrested and locked up,” he told the
constables.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll have to catch him first,” said Tim, with
a shake of his head, “and there’s no telling where
he might jump off the freight. We’ll have to send
out posters with his picture on, same as the regular
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>police do. Were you thinking of offering a reward?”
he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” answered the deacon. “At least not yet.
We’ll try to catch him without one first. Later
on—well, I’ll see.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was nothing more to be done that night,
and in the morning Deacon Blackford swore out a
warrant for Joe’s arrest.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVI<br> <span class='large'>THE SMASHED WATCH</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Even larger crowds than attended on the first
evening, greeted Joe Strong and Professor Rosello
at the two following performances. The wonder of
the disappearing trick, as well as the marvels of
others, had been well spread throughout Lorilard
by the small boys, and by grown persons as well,
and many bought tickets determined to “see how it
was done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the stage-hand who let Joe down through
the trap in the floor kept his own counsel, and
though many persons said they were sure they knew
how the feat was performed and that Joe <i>must</i> go
down through the stage, since it was obvious he did
not go up in the air, still they could not understand
how the piece of paper was not broken.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you certainly brought me good luck,”
said the professor to Joe at the conclusion of the
third night’s performance. “We took in good
money. You have more than earned your salary.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m glad to know that,” answered Joe, much
gratified. “Do you think I shall succeed as a
magician?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>“I’m sure of it! You learn quickly, and you
have natural and inherited ability. Practice will
make you perfect. I will help you all I can.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe had worked much more smoothly the third
night than on either of the two previous ones. The
“disappearance” trick had gone off well, and the
professor had let Joe do one or two simple mystification
acts himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“As we go along I will gradually let you do more
and more on the stage,” said Professor Rosello,
“until you get so you can sometimes take my place.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are very kind,” returned Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should think I ought to be,” the magician
went on. “I owe my life to you, and it will take
a good while to pay that debt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>During the next few weeks Joe traveled about
from town to town with Professor Rosello, helping
him in many ways aside from on the stage. For
there were many details to look after in hiring
theatres, sending on posters in advance, transporting
the baggage and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe’s work was so successful, and his working
of what tricks he did so smooth, that Professor
Rosello let him take a certain specified part in the
performances now.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll add some new tricks, too,” said the
magician. “I can afford to do that now, as we are
taking in a good deal of money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>So some new apparatus was bought, and a young
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>man, or rather an overgrown boy, hired to relieve
Joe of some of the detail work. Thus Joe could
devote more time to the tricks and to practice. The
professor’s “show” was not a large one, and he
did not play in the big cities, or, if he did, it was
in the small theatres or in halls. But Joe was
in good company, and he was getting valuable experience.
He often wondered what was going on
in Bedford, and whether his disappearance had
caused any stir.</p>

<p class='c007'>It had. The robbery at the deacon’s house became
known, and also the fact of the accusation
against Joe, who was being sought by the police.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, Joe may have run away, because he
couldn’t stand it any longer,” said Tom Simpson,
when he found his suit of clothes and the note the
morning after Joe had left them on the door-step.
“Joe Strong may have run away, but he never
stole!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right!” agreed his other chums.</p>

<p class='c007'>But of all this Joe knew nothing.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young wizard, which he was rapidly becoming
in earnest, kept at his chosen work. He practiced
sleight-of-hand at every opportunity. Nor
did he neglect his physical welfare. In many of the
places he visited there were Y. M. C. A. gymnasiums,
and there Joe paid a small fee for the
privilege of using the trapeze or the bars. This
he did during the day, while waiting for the night’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>performance. He would end his exercise with a
shower bath, and be in fine trim for the evening’s
work. He did the disappearing trick every night
of the show, and it always went well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe also did considerable studying, for the professor
had a number of books on magic. And one
evening after a successful performance Joe approached
Professor Rosello, and said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think I have invented a new trick.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good!” exclaimed the professor. “Let’s hear
about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I say <i>think</i>,” Joe reminded him, “for, though
I haven’t seen you do it, you may know about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then described the feat, explaining what apparatus
would be necessary to have it properly
worked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, that’s a good one!” cried Professor Rosello.
“It’s great, Joe! And I’ll let you do it yourself,
as is your right. I’ll order what you want, and
you can practice it, for remember this: a new trick
requires lots of practice to make it run smoothly.
There’s nothing worse for a magician’s reputation
than to have a slip-up when he is working a piece
of magic. So practice the new trick well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe promised that he would, and when the three
simple pieces of apparatus were received he devoted
much time to perfecting the details of his
little bit of mysticism.</p>

<p class='c007'>The evening came on which Joe was to do his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>new trick. The ones the professor did were successfully
worked, and while Mr. Crabb went behind
the scenes to “load” himself for his next act,
Joe stepped forward, and, addressing the audience,
said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“For this trick I should like to borrow a gold
gentleman’s watch—I should say a gentleman’s
gold watch.” The audience laughed at his pretended
slip, and this is always a good beginning.
There was a moment’s hesitation, and Joe added:
“I will return it safely. Come now, can’t I get one
gold watch from some one in this large and intelligent-looking
audience? Ah, thank you, here is
a trusting gentleman,” and he accepted a gold
watch which a man in the front row held up. He
was not a confederate. Joe had never seen him
before, but he took this watch because it
was an open-faced one, of just the size he
wanted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now before I go on with this trick,” resumed
Joe, as he took his place in the center of the stage,
“I will, for safe keeping, place the watch in this
paper bag.” He held up what seemed to be an
ordinary paper bag such as grocers use. The watch
went into it, and Joe then twisted the bag up around
the watch, the paper assuming a circular form
the shape of the watch being plainly visible.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll just lay the watch, in the bag, on the floor
here for a moment,” the young wizard went on. “It
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>will be perfectly safe, I’m sure. I just want to
ask a few questions of the owner.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe then went through some “patter” improvised
for the occasion, asking the man who had lent
him the watch, how long he had had it, whether it
kept good time, if it were valuable, and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>In the midst of this talk Joe walked about, and
then, seemingly by accident, he stepped on the paper
bag. There was an instant crunch as if of a broken
crystal, and a gasp came from the audience. The
man who owned the watch looked rather startled.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Dear me! This is quite too bad!” exclaimed
Joe, stooping to pick up the paper bag and the
stepped-on watch. “I am very sorry, sir, but you
know accidents will happen. You should have
warned me that I was going to step on your watch,
my dear sir.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I—you——” began the man, rather red in
the face.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep still!” his wife cautioned him. “It’s only
a trick, you know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man became silent, but wore a worried look.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, let us see just how bad the damage is,”
Joe went on. He took the watch from the bag and
held it up. The crystal was cracked in all directions,
and a slight pressure from Joe’s thumb sent
it into fragments of glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, dear! Worse and worse!” Joe exclaimed.
“Well, since I have broken this much of the watch,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>I might as well finish it. I’ll put it in this mortar,”
and he brought forward a small wooden one, shaped
as all druggists’ mortars are.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s nothing in it, you see,” he went on holding
it so the audience could look into the interior.
“Quite empty,” and Joe rattled his wand inside.
“So it can’t hurt your watch to go in there.” He
shook the fragments of glass on the now smoothed-out
paper bag, and carefully lowered the watch,
with its back toward the audience, into the
mortar.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now we’ll see what we can do,” Joe went on,
taking up the pestle. This, as you know, is the object
with which a druggist grinds up in the mortar
any medicine requiring crushing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll make a thorough job of this while we’re
at it,” Joe went on, as he proceeded to grind away
with the pestle on the bottom of the mortar.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come! This is too slow. I shall have to use
something heavier, I think, to make mince-meat of
this watch. It is a very tough one. I’ll use this
poker,” and he picked up an iron one, laying aside
the pestle on a table. With the poker Joe jabbed
away at the bottom of the mortar, wherein, a few
moments previous, the audience had seen him place
the watch.</p>

<p class='c007'>A rattling, grinding sound was heard, a clink of
metal, and Joe exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ah, now we are getting on famously! You
<span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>will hardly know your watch again, my dear sir.
It is all in pieces.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The man did not seem to know whether to look
amused or angry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There we are!” Joe exclaimed, as he held the
mortar slantingly so the audience could look inside.
They, as well as the gentleman who had lent
the watch, saw the crushed and bent wheels, springs
and pinions of a watch, all massed together.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I couldn’t do much worse to your watch.
I think you’ll agree to that, my dear sir?” said Joe
to the man.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” he admitted, rather ruefully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And now to try what a little magic will do,”
said Joe. “Since I have destroyed your watch, I’ll
do my best to restore it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He poured from the mortar the fragments of a
watch, putting them on the paper bag together with
the pieces of glass. He then wadded them all up
together, and crammed them into the mouth of a
large, old-fashioned pistol.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now watch me closely,” Joe said.</p>

<p class='c007'>And one may well believe the audience, as well
as the man who owned the watch, did watch.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVII<br> <span class='large'>JOE LEARNS SOMETHING</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>The young wizard made a few “magical” passes
in the air over the pistol he held up in front of the
audience, which was now keyed up to a point of
nervous anticipation. The man whose watch had
been borrowed was half out of his seat. He seemed
about to protest against the liberties being taken
with his property, but his wife, cooler headed than
he, whispered to him:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s all right. You’ll get your watch back.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But how can I when he——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush!” she cautioned him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If agreeable to you,” went on Joe, smiling, “I
will fire the fragments of the watch from this pistol,
and cause it to appear, whole, reunited and undamaged,
in that flower.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As he spoke he aimed the pistol at a small,
potted, flowering plant on a table at the back of
the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll cause the watch to appear hanging from a
pink ribbon among the roots of that plant. And
here is the ribbon I will use,” and Joe rammed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>down the barrel of the pistol a small length of silk
ribbon which he picked up from a table near him.</p>

<p class='c007'>He aimed his weapon at the plant and fired.
There was the usual jumping and screaming from
some of the women in the audience, as Joe walked
over to the plant. In plain view of the audience
he lifted it, roots, earth and all from the pot, and
there, as he had said, dangling from a pink ribbon,
was a watch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I believe this is your property, sir,” he said to
the man who had lent the timepiece, and Joe detached
it, ribbon and all, from a short branch of the
plant over which the ribbon was looped.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it your watch?” Joe asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why—er—yes, it is! But I don’t see how in
the world you made it whole again.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s one of the secrets of magic,” returned
Joe, smiling, and bowing to the applause that followed.
His trick had been a great success, as he
had hoped.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Rosello now came on the stage to
work one of his feats, and Joe retired to get ready
for his part in it. And while he is doing that the
explanation of the watch trick will be given.</p>

<p class='c007'>It stands to reason that no one can take a perfectly
good watch, step on it, break the crystal, beat
it to pieces, ram it into a pistol and by firing it at
a plant cause the timepiece to appear whole again
among the roots. This is how it is done.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>In the first place Joe had provided himself with
the following articles for his trick: A paper bag,
ordinary, except that inside it were some small
lumps of hard sugar, held from rattling about by
small strips of paper pasted over them. Also on
one side of the bag was pasted a triangular piece
of paper forming a sort of pocket, which was not
visible when the bag was quickly held up in front
of the audience. In a secret pocket of his suit
Joe had a watch crystal which had been scored in
crisscross fashion by a diamond, so that it appeared
to be cracked in every direction. The cuts
made by the diamond were so deep in the glass
that a slight pressure would cause the crystal to
break into scores of pieces.</p>

<p class='c007'>The other piece of apparatus was a trick mortar
and pestle. The mortar had a false inside bottom
which fitted closely but not too tightly. Below
this bottom Joe had placed, beforehand, the fragments
of a cheap watch—wheels, springs and so on.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pestle was also a trick one. In the large
end there was a hollow, large enough to hold a
watch, and the opening was closed by a piece of
wood exactly the same shape and size as the false
inside bottom of the mortar. The end of the pestle
and the bottom of the mortar were interchangeable.</p>

<p class='c007'>The pistol Joe used was the regular stage kind.
That is it had two barrels. Into the larger the
objects, in this case the fragments of a watch, were
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>placed. The other barrel fired a light charge of
powder.</p>

<p class='c007'>The flowering plant was a real one—there was no
trick about that except that the earth around the
roots had been previously made loose, so it would
pull up easily.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe, with all these things, was ready for his trick.
He borrowed the watch and placed it in the paper
bag.</p>

<p class='c007'>That is, he seemed to do so, but, in reality, he
slipped it into the little outside triangular pocket
he had pasted there for it. He could now hold the
bag up, with the side containing the watch away
from the audience, and, as he showed both hands
empty, every one thought the watch was in the bag.
It was, in a sense.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe then twisted the bag up, making it conform
to the shape of the watch, and when this point
was reached he quietly slipped the watch out from
the pocket into his hand, cleverly “palming” the
timepiece. With the watch safe in his hand, he
laid the bag on the floor of the stage. The paper
still retaining its round shape, and no one suspected
that the watch was not in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then Joe stepped on the paper bag. Of course
it sounded as if he had broken the watch crystal,
but, in reality, what the audience heard was the
crunching of the lumps of sugar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe pretended to be much exercised as he picked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>up the bag, and as he did this, he slipped the watch
into his secret pocket, and managed to put over
its glass face the crystal he had previously prepared
by scoring and criss-crossing with the diamond.
When this was done Joe again palmed
the real watch, but now it had over its face a glass
that seemed to be cracked in all directions.</p>

<p class='c007'>Reaching his hand, in which the watch was
palmed, inside the bag, Joe seemingly brought out
the cracked watch. Again he manifested much
concern, and more so when a pressure of his thumb
really broke the prepared glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he was ready for the mortar and pestle part
of the trick. He put the fragments of glass on the
paper bag, and lowered the watch, with its back
toward the audience, into the pestle. This was
done so that no one would see that the crystal
was still whole and uncracked, which was the
case.</p>

<p class='c007'>The real watch was now in the mortar, but it
did not actually rest on the bottom. Instead it
rested on the false piece of wood, and beneath
this wood, in a hollowed-out place, were the pieces
of a cheap watch.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Joe looked down into the pestle, as though to
see that the watch was all ready to be pounded up,
he “palmed” off the false head of the pestle. This
left that instrument with a hollow head, inside
which would fit the real watch, to be concealed from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>view by the loose false bottom of the mortar, when
the pestle was lifted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe now put the pestle into the mortar, slipping
the opening in the pestle over the watch and false
bottom, and by a slight rotary motion causing the
false bottom of the mortar to fit itself into the pestle
and stick there. The real watch was now concealed
in the hollow head of the pestle, while the fragments
of the cheap watch were exposed in the bottom of
the mortar.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe now pretended that the pestle was not strong
enough to smash up the watch as he wanted it, and
used a poker. He laid the pestle on the table, which
was a signal for the boy assistant to take it out behind
the scenes. And while he had the pestle there
the boy took out the real watch, quickly tied a pink
ribbon through the ring, and then, going to one of
the curtains, in which was a slit, he reached through
this slit and suspended the ribbon on a short branch
of the flower, letting it hang down out of sight behind
the pot. Of course the audience did not see
this, for the folds of the curtain concealed the slit.
Besides, all eyes were on Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The young wizard had now gotten the real watch
just where he wanted it, on the plant, where he
could “produce” it whenever he wanted to. But the
trick was not yet finished. Joe ground away with
the poker at the pieces of the cheap watch already
in the pestle. He then showed the pieces to the audience,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>poured them out on the paper bag, where
the pieces of glass already were. The whole was
then wadded up, put into the trick pistol, and the
rest was a mere matter of detail. Joe walked over,
picked up the pot, pulled the plant up by the roots,
the watch of course seeming to have been down in
the dirt. And, naturally, the watch was not in the
least damaged, though it seemed to have gone
through all sorts of misfortunes.</p>

<p class='c007'>The real secret of the trick, aside from the
sleight-of-hand work necessary, lay in the prepared
paper bag and the mortar and pestle, which were
made for just such mystification as this.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It went very well, Joe,” said the professor, at
the conclusion of the performance. “That little
piece of ribbon added to it.” For Joe had thought
to put into the pistol a bit of ribbon such as that
by which the watch was suspended. Otherwise he
could not have accounted for the piece on the ring
of the watch.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think they liked it?” Joe asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m sure they did. You may do that trick at
each place where we perform. And if you can
work up any new ones, do so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I will!” promised Joe, much delighted with his
progress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Inventing new tricks is not as easy as might be
supposed, and for the next few days Joe suggested
feats to Professor Rosello only to have them refused
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>as not being effective enough or as too old.
But Joe was not discouraged.</p>

<p class='c007'>At a performance one night in the town of Cardiff,
Joe had occasion to walk down among the audience
to exhibit some pieces of apparatus, to show
that there was nothing concealed about it. As he
passed one row of seats he was surprised to hear
a boyish voice say:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Joe!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He looked around and saw Harry Martin, one
of his chums from Bedford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, hello, Harry!” Joe ejaculated. “What in
the world are you doing here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’m visiting my uncle who lives here. But I
never expected to see you in a show like this. I
never was so surprised as when you came out on
the stage. I couldn’t believe my eyes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’ve been with the professor some time,”
said Joe quickly. “Ever since I—er—I came away
from home. But come back of the scenes after the
show, Harry. I’d like to have a talk with you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I with you, Joe. I want to tell you I don’t
believe what they are saying about you, either.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Saying about me, Harry?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I’ll tell you later.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was puzzled as he went on with the trick, and
he eagerly awaited the advent of his chum behind
the scenes after the show was over.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What is it they’re saying about me, Harry?”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>asked the young wizard. “Do they blame me for
leaving a home I couldn’t stand any longer?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Not that so much, Joe. But don’t you know
you are accused of robbing Deacon Blackford and
setting fire to his place?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What?” cried Joe. “You don’t mean that!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes I do,” said Harry. “I mean that’s what
you’re accused of, but I don’t believe it!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe sank into a chair.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XVIII<br> <span class='large'>THE MAGIC EGG</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Don’t take it so to heart, Joe,” begged Harry,
after a moment’s pause. “I didn’t mean to spring
it on you this way. I thought maybe you knew
something about it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t know a thing!” exclaimed Joe. Professor
Rosello and the boy helper were busy putting
away their apparatus, so Joe and Harry could talk
together for a time. “How did they come to accuse
me?” Joe asked, after a pause.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you ran away, you know,” began Harry.
“Of course that wasn’t so bad, considering what
you had to put up with. And the same night you
went off, the deacon was robbed.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of much?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“To hear him tell it you’d think it was. About
a hundred dollars of his money and nearly forty
dollars of his wife’s.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“She kept hers in the clock and his was in the
desk,” said Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Better not let any one else hear you say that,”
Harry cautioned him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>“Why not?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because they’ll only be more suspicious of you,
seeing you knew where the money was kept.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, that isn’t anything. I couldn’t very well
help knowing, being in the house all the while. But
was anything else taken?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, some valuable papers.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And what about a fire?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, the deacon says he heard a noise, got up
to see what it was, and saw some one getting out
of the window near his desk. Whoever it was
kicked over the lamp, which exploded. The deacon
says he knows you didn’t mean to start the
fire.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What made him think it was I getting out the
window?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He didn’t—that is, not at the time. But when
he went to call you, and found you weren’t in your
room, then he jumped to the conclusion that you
had taken the money and papers and climbed out
of the window.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t do either,” Joe said. “I went out the
door in a hurry when I heard the deacon after me.
That is, I thought I heard him. I’m beginning to
believe now it was the noise made by the real burglars
that frightened me. But is that all the evidence
they have against me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Hen Sylvester and Tim Donovan saw you
running away in the middle of the night, and jump
<span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>the midnight freight. They chased after you and
fired some shots, but you wouldn’t stop.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“By Jove! That’s right!” cried Joe. “That <i>will</i>
look suspicious.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you <i>did</i> run away from them?” asked
Harry.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, but not because I had robbed the deacon.
I was late for the freight. You see it pulled out
earlier than usual because there wasn’t so much of
the fireworks to load, on account of the fire. I
didn’t want to miss it, and I ran. I wouldn’t stop
when the constables called to me. Yes, that sure
will look suspicious;” and Joe shook his head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But we don’t believe you did it,” said Harry.
“Tom, Charlie, Henry and I will stick to you, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Thanks. Did Tom get his suit all right?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes. But I sure was surprised when I
saw you come out on the stage to-night. We hadn’t
any idea where you’d gone, though Deacon Blackford
said he guessed you’d join some circus.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“This isn’t quite a circus,” said Joe. “But I
like it,” and then he told his chum his experiences
since joining his fortunes with those of Professor
Rosello.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, it’s great!” cried Harry, with sparkling
eyes. “I wish I were a magician.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’m not one yet,” replied Joe. “It takes a
lot more experience than I’ve had. But I’m learning.
How did you like the show?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>“Fine! That watch trick of yours was a dandy.
You didn’t really smash the watch and put it together
again, did you, Joe?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Of course not. There was a trick about it, but
I don’t feel at liberty to tell you how it’s done. You
see the trick, in a way, belongs to Professor Rosello.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I don’t want you to tell me. It would spoil
it for me when I saw it again. I’m coming to-morrow
night.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Come on,” urged Joe. “Here, I’ll write you
out a pass. It isn’t often I get a chance to do that
for a friend.”</p>

<p class='c007'>They were showing two nights in this particular
town, and Professor Rosello gladly allowed Joe to
give Harry a free ticket.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, you’re sure making out better than you
ever would in Bedford, Joe,” commented his chum,
as they parted that evening.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I couldn’t stand it there. The deacon
wasn’t fair to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, we boys miss you,” Harry said.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Give ’em my regards when you go back,” Joe
suggested, “and tell the deacon I never took his
money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sure will, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A few nights later, Joe, in his capacity as assistant,
was helping the professor, who was doing an
egg trick—balancing the egg on the end of a straw.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>The straws were genuine ones, as were the eggs.
The secret lay in a little piece of apparatus, so
small as to be readily palmed almost before the very
eyes of the audience. It consisted of a little celluloid
cup, so shallow as to be almost flat, but concave
enough to hold the end of an egg. There was a
little stem, half an inch long, on the lower side of
this celluloid cup.</p>

<p class='c007'>After the professor had invited some one in the
audience to make an egg stand up on end on the
point of a straw, which the person, of course, could
not do, the professor did it himself, deftly slipping
the projection of the celluloid cup into the hollow
of the straw. The egg then stood up in the little
piece of celluloid, which, being the exact color of
an egg and as thin as the shell, was never noticed.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Joe watched this familiar trick being done,
there came into his mind the idea for another one,
even more simple, and requiring no apparatus whatever
except an ordinary glass jar. He spoke to
the professor about it the next day, and was given
permission to work it.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just before he “put on” his watch trick the next
night, Joe announced that he would try a little
experiment with an egg.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You all know that a perfectly fresh egg will
sink in water,” he said. “In fact, that is a test for
a fresh egg. Now I have here three perfectly good
and fresh eggs. I know they are fresh because I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>bought them this afternoon from your popular grocer,
Mr. McCabe, and he told me he never sold any
<i>but</i> fresh eggs.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a laugh at this, and every one turned
to look at the grocer, who was in the audience, a
fact that Joe knew, for he had really purchased
the eggs at the grocery. Thus he had his audience
with him at the start, a reference to a local personage
from the stage by a traveling performer
invariably producing an effect.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now as you all know,” Joe went on, “a fresh
egg sinks in water. You can prove it at home, and
I’ll prove it here for you. Just pick out any one of
these eggs,” he said, and, extending them on a plate
to a woman in the audience, he took from her the
egg she picked up.</p>

<p class='c007'>“The lady looks like a good cook, she ought to
know good eggs,” said Joe, and again there was a
laugh.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I’ll just put this egg in this jar of water,”
went on the young magician; “but instead of sinking,
when I speak the magic word, it will remain
floating half-way between the top of the water
and the bottom of the jar. Now watch me
closely.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe gently lowered the egg into the jar of water
that stood on a table near him. Slowly the egg
settled through the limpid fluid.</p>

<p class='c007'>“By the magic of this wand, I command you to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>stop!” cried Joe, as the egg was half-way down, and
as he waved his stick the egg did stop midway.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see how easy it is,” the young performer
continued. “I did not touch the egg after I placed
it in the water, nor did I approach the glass jar.
You may examine both in a moment. I will now
dissolve the magic spell I have cast about the egg.
With my wand I make some passes—so——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe put his wand into the water and stirred it
about the egg, but did not touch it. In a second
the egg slowly sank to the bottom of the jar, to
the mystification of the audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You may think there is some trick about it,” said
Joe. “But any one of you is at liberty to try and
make the egg halt half-way down, as I did. Will
you try it?” he said to the woman who had picked
out the egg.</p>

<p class='c007'>She blushed and shook her head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you, please,” and Joe indicated a young
man, who, sheepishly enough, came up on the stage.
Joe handed him the jar of water, the young
man reached down into it, got the egg and put it
in the jar as Joe had done. But the egg at once
sank to the bottom, and though the young man
tried again, he had no success.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You see, it’s magic,” laughed Joe, as he made
ready for his smashed watch trick.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XIX<br> <span class='large'>THE CIRCUS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>And now for the explanation of the egg trick. It
is so simple that any of you may do it at home,
with just an ordinary egg, a fruit jar and some
salt. Don’t forget the salt.</p>

<p class='c007'>You have all heard the story, told to children,
about putting salt on a bird’s tail in order to tame
it. Well, a fresh egg that one wishes to make float
half-way submerged in a jar of water, must be
treated in the same way. It must be salted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Just as Joe said, a fresh egg will sink in water.
But it will float in strong brine, or salt water, the
reason being that salt water is denser, and has a
greater specific gravity, than fresh water.</p>

<p class='c007'>But the trick lies in combining fresh and salt
water so that the egg will sink only half-way.</p>

<p class='c007'>Make a strong brine solution by dissolving common
table salt in water. It may be necessary to
experiment a little before getting the solution just
the right strength. Fill a glass fruit jar, or any
jar with a wide opening, half full of the brine.
Now, with a funnel, pour fresh water in on top of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>the salt water. Be careful not to let the two kinds
of water mix. The salt water, being heavier, will
be on the bottom of the jar, and the fresh, being
lighter, on top. If you do it carefully enough,
pouring in a little fresh water at a time, you will
have, as Joe had, a jar with two layers of different
kinds of water—one salt, the other fresh. The
audience, of course, can not see this, as they could
if you had two differently colored fluids, for the
salt and fresh water are of the same color.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Joe put the egg in the water he lowered it
carefully, so as not to disturb the two water layers.
The egg sank through the strata of fresh water,
but when it came to the layer of dense, salt water,
it would not sink in that, and came to a stop, half-way
down, just as Joe, who knew at what point
this would occur, uttered the command to stop.</p>

<p class='c007'>And when Joe pretended, to dissolve the “spell,”
he merely, with his wand, stirred together the fresh
and salt water. This made a mixture of salt water,
but it was not dense, or heavy, enough to support
the egg, which of course sank to the bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>And, as the waters were well mixed when Joe
let the young man try the experiment, of course the
latter could not make the egg float as the boy wizard
had done.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was a good trick, Joe,” was the professor’s
compliment when Joe came off the stage. “In fact
I think the simpler the trick is, the better, but there
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>are very few that can be worked with so little apparatus
as your egg experiment. We’ll keep that
on our list.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe had told his employer about the news brought
by Harry, to the effect that our hero was accused
of robbery by his foster-parent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you going to do about it, Joe?” asked
the professor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see that I can do anything. I didn’t take
a dollar of his money, or Mrs. Blackford’s either,
nor did I touch the valuable papers. It’s all a mistake,
but I’m not going back there to tell him so.
I sent word by Harry. If he won’t believe him, he
won’t believe me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, perhaps not. And, as you say, you can’t
go back there just to convince your foster-father.
You don’t think, do you, that he will make trouble
for you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t imagine so.”</p>

<p class='c007'>When Joe said this he knew nothing of the warrant
having been sworn out for his arrest. Harry
had not told his chum of this detail.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then I don’t see that you need do anything,”
said Mr. Crabb. “I, myself, don’t believe the accusation
against you. And until you are put to some
real trouble over it you may as well ignore it.
We’ll just go on as usual. You are doing well, and
our show is succeeding better than I hoped for. I
am glad you came to me.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>Joe was grateful for this trust, and resolved to
do his best in his future work. He worked up
several new and simple tricks, many of them, such
as dancing cards, the nodding skull and others, being
adaptations from other stage illusions.</p>

<p class='c007'>You have, most of you, perhaps, seen a magician
suspend a card, apparently in mid-air, and cause it
to go up or down as some one in the audience requests.
Sometimes a metal ball on a rod is used.
These tricks are worked by means of a black thread
which is attached to the card or ball and is pulled
by a confederate behind the scenes.</p>

<p class='c007'>Indeed, the black silk thread has been called the
magician’s best friend. It is absolutely invisible
on the lighted stage against the proper background,
and the right kind is strong enough to lift considerable
weight.</p>

<p class='c007'>A card chosen from the pack is made to rise or
fall as follows: the magician gets possession of
the card selected by some one in the audience, either
by keeping his finger in the place in the pack into
which it is thrust, or by “forcing” a certain card
on the person in the audience. The performer
knows what card he is going to “force” and, later,
can readily pick it out of the pack as he shuffles it.
To “force” a card, the operator rapidly spreads out
a pack of cards, face down, in front of a person,
and quickly thrusts one card out farther than the
others, literally “forcing” it into the hand. It is a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>predetermined card, but not one in a hundred
realizes that.</p>

<p class='c007'>At any rate, having the card, the performer goes
back to the stage and adroitly contrives to fasten
the card to the unseen black silk thread with a tiny
bit of beeswax. Then, with the card apparently
suspended in mid-air, but in reality hung by an unseen
thread, which runs through screw-eyes on the
stage floor, the card is made to go up or down or
stop midway, just as the audience calls for, by the
pulling of the thread by the assistant behind the
scenes. When the trick is over the performer slyly
takes the card off the pellet of wax, no trace of
which shows, and passes the card around for examination.
Of course it is an ordinary card. The
trick was all in the string.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe made a variation of that trick by using a
round-bottomed little papier-maché figure, bought
in a toy store. There was no trick about the figure.
It was one of those which can not be made to lie
down, but continually bob up, because of a weight
of lead in the rounded bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe laid a glass shelf across the backs of two
chairs, and after passing the little round-bottomed
figure about for inspection, returned with it to the
stage, placing it on the glass shelf.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This little figure, by bowing to the right or to
the left, will now answer questions without assistance
from me,” Joe announced. “A bow to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>left will mean ‘no,’ and a nod to the right will mean
‘yes.’ Or you may have it the other way if you
like. Which shall it be?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The choice being thus left to the audience it
seems impossible that there can be any prearrangement.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Right bow for ‘no,’” some one called.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Very well,” agreed Joe, smiling. “It’s all the
same to me. A bow to the right will stand for
‘no,’ and the nod to the opposite direction will mean
‘yes.’”</p>

<p class='c007'>All this while the little figure rested on the glass
shelf. Not a bit of mechanism was to be observed,
and Joe walked down from the stage and stood in
the audience after placing the figure on the glass.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now we will ask questions,” announced the
young performer. “Is the lady on my right married?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No,” nodded the figure.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is she willing to be?” he went on, amid laughter,
while the young lady blushed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” nodded the figure, amid still heartier
laughter.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe asked many other questions, easily answered
by no or yes. He did not take the trouble to find
out if the answers were correct. The questions followed
one another quickly, and the audience was interested
in noting the movements of the figure,
with no one on the stage, with Joe far away from it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>and with nothing but a plain glass shelf on which
the figure rested.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Joe had caused enough fun and mystification
with this trick, he walked back to the stage,
picked up the figure and tossed it to a little boy in
a front seat.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Take it home with you, youngster,” he said.
“See if you can make it behave as I did.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Several interested ones around the boy examined
the figure. There was no deception about it, and
the giving of it away proved this. In fact Joe
found that a good climax to the trick.</p>

<p class='c007'>And now—how was it done?</p>

<p class='c007'>Beforehand two black threads were passed from
behind the scenes up through the rounds of the
chairs, over the backs and up on the glass shelf,
where they met in the middle, each thread ending
in a little pellet of wax. When Joe apparently
carelessly placed the figure on the glass shelf he
fastened one of the waxed ends of thread to either
side of the half-rounded bottom.</p>

<p class='c007'>He then went entirely away from the stage,
and all that remained was for the assistant behind
the scenes to pull one thread to make the figure
bow to the right, and another to cause it to nod
to the left. Of course the assistant heard all that
was said, and could govern himself according to
the choice of the audience. It was an effective
trick, and beautifully simple. You might even try
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>it yourself, but be sure the black threads do not
show. It is for this reason that most magicians
have dark draperies for a stage background.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Where do we go next?” asked Joe of the professor
the night after he had first introduced his
magic figure trick, which had gone so well with the
audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hillsburg is the next town, and we ought to
make quite some money there, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You deserve more money,” proceeded Mr.
Crabb, “and I am going to give it to you. You
are certainly a valuable addition to my show, and
in time you will be able to carry on a whole performance
yourself. You still have something to
learn in palming, in making substitutions, and in
manipulating cards. But that takes practice and
time. I have great hopes of you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>But alas for the hopes of doing a good business
in Hillsburg! When they reached that town, they
found that a circus was playing there on the same
date as Professor Rosello’s show.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No use trying to compete with a circus,” observed
the professor, as he heard the news at the
small hotel where they put up. “We’ll just wait
over a couple of days, Joe, and perhaps we can
think up some new tricks in the meanwhile. A rest
will do us no harm. I’ll just cancel to-day’s engagement
here, and put the show on two nights
later. By that time we can get a crowd.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>“Then you haven’t anything for me to do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, Joe.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess, then, I’ll go out and see them get ready
for the circus. I may take in the show, too.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Please yourself, Joe,” said the professor, as his
young helper went out. “I didn’t think he could
resist the attraction of the sawdust rings of a circus,”
he murmured to himself with a smile.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XX<br> <span class='large'>SOME TRAPEZE TRICKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Joe did not have to ask his way to the circus
grounds. He had only to follow the crowd, mostly
made up of small boys, though with a goodly
sprinkling of young men, all of whom were stringing
their way out to the big, vacant lots where the
tents were being put up, and where the big cages,
wagons, horses, and animals were getting ready
for the parade that was to follow.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They’ll likely have the horse and animal tents
up by this time,” mused Joe, “but I can see ’em
fixing the main top.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The largest tent, or the one where the performance
is given, is called in circus language the “main
top.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe knew something of circuses from having
read of them and having seen one or two, but also
he remembered a very little, and seemed, too, to
have inherited a certain knowledge.</p>

<p class='c007'>It would have been strange had he not had a
hankering for a tent show, for the son of Madame
Hortense, one of the greatest circus riders of her
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>day, ought to have something of a liking for that
strange life.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if, by any chance, I’d meet some one
who used to know my mother,” mused Joe, as he
walked onward. “It isn’t so very many years ago
that she was with a show, and there might be some
old-time performers who would know her. But it’s
hardly likely, though possible. Of course my father,
having been mostly in theatre shows, wouldn’t
be so apt to know circus people. Say, it almost
makes me want to be with ’em!” Joe murmured enthusiastically,
as he came in sight of the circus lots
on which lively scenes were being enacted.</p>

<p class='c007'>Men were running about, straightening out the
big folds of canvas, lacing up the parts of the big
tent preparatory to raising it, for the “main top”
comes in several sections for easier transportation.</p>

<p class='c007'>Gay banners were fluttering from the animal tent,
already up, and from the one where the performers
were to eat and dress.</p>

<p class='c007'>Breakfast had already been served to the now
busy workers; and from the wagons, on which
were the big stoves, there arose appetizing odors,
as a second meal was being gotten ready—a
breakfast for the performers who did not have to
get up as early as did the laborers. Most of the
circus stuff had been brought from the railroad
trains, and was on the grounds.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see how they ever straighten things out,”
<span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>mused Joe. But somehow it was done. Every
one had a certain part to perform. And while one
gang of men were putting up the tents, others were
feeding the horses and other animals, and those
in charge of the parade were getting that ready
to march through the streets in order to entice
the small boy and his parent to come to the
show.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe strolled past the place where, outside one of
the performers’ tents, men were pasting paper on
the hoops through which the riders would leap
later. He did not stop to peer in at the animals,
though many small boys were feasting their eyes
on such glimpses of the sights as they could see.
Joe did not care much for this.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wish I could see some of the trapeze and high
wire fellows at practice,” he mused. “I might pick
up a few stunts myself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe passed a place where some of the performers’
trunks had been heaped up in readiness to
be taken into the dressing tents. Near them stood
a tall, slim, young fellow, of about Joe’s age. He
did not seem very muscular, and he was tugging
away at a heavy trunk, which he could not move.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Shan’t I give you a hand?” asked Joe pleasantly.
“That looks pretty heavy.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is,” was the answer, given with a smile. “I
ought to have some of the men help me, but they’re
all too busy. My trunk is under this one, and I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>want to get at it. There’s a hole in my suit I want
to get mended before the show opens.”</p>

<p class='c007'>From that Joe knew the lad to be one of the
performers.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess I can get it down for you,” said the
young wizard, and with a heave of his powerful
arms he lifted down the top trunk.</p>

<p class='c007'>“My, but you’re strong!” exclaimed the other,
somewhat enviously.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Strong is my last name,” laughed Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is it, really?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sure is. Can I help you carry it to your dressing
room?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, if you don’t mind, it would be a favor.
I generally have one of the men help me, but we’re
a bit late to-day, on account of a train wreck that
held us up, and everybody is doing double work.
My place is right over there,” and he indicated the
tent where he had his dressing room, or, rather,
space, for all do not have separate rooms in a circus.</p>

<p class='c007'>As Joe took hold of one end of the trunk he
noticed that it bore, in big, white letters the words:</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>HUMAN FISH</div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c007'>Joe’s face must have showed his surprise, for the
circus lad noticed it, and with a laugh, said:</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t an aquarium you’re helping to carry.
This just has my clothes and some other things
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>in it—the suit I wear—I’m the ‘human fish,’ you
know.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You are—a fish?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Turton’s my right name, Benny Turton,
but I’m billed as the ‘human fish.’ I do an act in
a tank of water—swimming, diving, staying under
a long time, picking coins up in my mouth and all
that. It isn’t a bad act they tell me.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Last night I ripped the suit I wear—sort of
fish-scale arrangement, you know, and I wanted to
get it out of my trunk early, to have it mended.
I’m much obliged to you,” he went on, as Joe set
his end of the trunk down in the dressing tent,
which was now becoming thronged with other performers
who were getting ready for the parade.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, you’re welcome, I’m sure,” Joe answered.
“I guess I’ll come and see you perform.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d be glad to have you. Say, if you’d like to
look about a bit now I can fix it up for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to see the trapeze fellows at practice.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right. I’ll speak to the ring-master. Oh, I
say Jim—Jim Tracy!” called the “human fish”
to a big, red-faced and black-mustached man who
entered the tent just then.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello, Ben, what is it now?” was the answer.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Here’s a friend of mine,” went on the “fish,”
with a smile. “His name is Strong. You ought
to see him juggle trunks. He wants to watch the
trapeze fellows doing some try-outs.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>“All right, Ben. As long as he’s a friend of
yours it goes. Make yourself at home, Strong,”
went on the ring-master, “and if anybody asks you
what you’re doing, tell ’em Jim Tracy said it was
all right. How you making out, Benny? Need
any help?” His voice seemed to take on a kinder
tone as he spoke to the rather frail looking
lad.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’m all right now. He gave me a hand just
when I needed it,” and he nodded to Joe. “Got to
get my suit mended, or I’ll be full of water before
my act’s half over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right—don’t spoil the act,” admonished
the ring-master. “It’s too good to have that happen.
Well, I’ve got about a thousand things to do.
See you later,” and with a nod to the two young
men he hurried off.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now you can go about as you like,” said Benny.
“He’s the head boss, and one of the owners of
Sampson Brothers’ Gigantic Aggregation of Circus
and Hippodrome,” said Ben with a laugh, as he
quoted part of the show bills. “What he says
goes!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Benny Turton, the “human fish,” had unlocked
his trunk, and was taking out a queer suit, made, it
seemed, of rubber, covered with shimmering green
scales like those of a fish.</p>

<p class='c007'>“This is supposed to be water-tight,” Benny explained,
“and it is, when it doesn’t leak. I’ve got
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>to put a patch on one elbow,” and he showed where
a rip would let water in. “I mend it with a rubber
cement,” he added, “and it takes a little time to
dry. That’s why I was in a hurry to get at it.
You’ll see some of the trapeze men at work soon,
I think. Come back when you’re through watching
them.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A little later Joe found himself in the main tent,
which was now almost completely erected, and as
soon as this had been done men began putting in
place the trapezes, flying rings and other pieces of
apparatus on which the acrobats performed their
feats.</p>

<p class='c007'>While this was going on a man came strolling in,
and from the anxious orders he gave, and from the
manner in which he watched the arranging of some
of the trapezes, Joe surmised that he was one of
the performers. He made sure of this a little
later when the man swung himself up on the bar,
tested it, and then began to go through a few simple
exercises in his street clothes, as though to test the
ropes and fastenings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right,” he called to the workmen. “That’ll
do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The Lascalla Brothers are mighty particular,”
murmured one of the workmen, as the performer
went out.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I should say so!” was the comment of another.
Then Joe knew he had seen one of the most famous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>of trapeze performers, whose name was in large
letters on the bills.</p>

<p class='c007'>One or two men questioned Joe’s presence, but
when he mentioned Jim Tracy he was made welcome.</p>

<p class='c007'>Most of the trapezes were in place, and the
workmen had gone to another part of the big tent.
Joe strolled over toward one of the swinging bars.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, wouldn’t I like to try it just once!” he
murmured. “I’ve never been on a real circus
trapeze.” He looked about him. No one seemed to
be noticing him. “Here goes!” he exclaimed.</p>

<p class='c007'>Lightly he sprang and grasped the bar. The
feel of it seemed natural to his hands, and he felt
his springy muscles contracting for the upward
pull. He swung lightly to the bar, and sat there,
moving to and fro.</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, in a sort of reckless spirit Joe went
through a number of evolutions, such as he had
often practiced alone at home or in some chum’s
barn.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was hampered by his street shoes and clothes
from doing very much, but what he did he did
well. Daring indeed were one or two of the feats
he attempted, for there was no life net below him.
He worked rapidly and then, giving a final swing
on the bar he shot off it, turned a somersault, and
landed on his feet on a pile of canvas some distance
off.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>“Say, that wasn’t bad! Better work in a little
of that new stuff to-day,” said a voice behind Joe.
The young wizard turned quickly to behold Jim
Tracy looking at him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hello! Oh, it’s you, is it?” asked the ring-master.
“Blessed if I didn’t think it was one of our
regular performers doing a try-out. Say, Ben
didn’t tell me you belonged to the profesh.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t. That is I’m an assistant to Professor
Rosello, a magician. I’m not a circus performer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it’s too bad you aren’t,” was the comment.
“I’ve seen some good tricks on a trapeze,
but you’ve got a few of your own. I don’t s’pose
you’d like to join the show, would you? I could
use an extra trapeze and ring act. Now if you’d
like to consider it, I’ll make you an offer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe’s heart beat high for a moment. He was almost
tempted to accept. Then he realized that he
had not yet perfected himself in the working of
magic, and he wanted to do this. So he shook his
head.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, thank you,” he said, gratefully. “I guess
I’ll stick to Professor Rosello for the present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you know your own business best,” answered
the ring-master, “and I sure don’t want to
take you away from the man you’re with. But
if ever you think of joining a circus, why drop
me a line. You’ll find us——”</p>

<p class='c007'>But the ring-master was suddenly interrupted.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>“Oh, Jim!” cried a voice, and Joe turned to behold,
what he afterward declared was, a “vision in
pink,” hurrying into the main tent. The “vision”
was a young girl, with a laughing face, merry
brown eyes and a vivacious manner.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Jim!” she cried. “I am in <i>such</i> trouble!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well now, Miss Helen, what’s the trouble?”
asked Jim in a good-natured voice, as though he
were speaking to some child. “We sure will have
to have it fixed for you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, thank you, Jim,” and the “vision” turned
and gazed full at Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe blushed.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXI<br> <span class='large'>ALMOST CAUGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“Well, now, Miss Helen, what’s the trouble?”
asked the ring-master, while Joe continued to gaze
at the “vision.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I can’t get any lump sugar for Rosebud, and
you know he won’t eat the other kind.” Her lips
pouted prettily, and then she smiled—Joe declared
at him, though it may have been at both of them.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No lump sugar, eh? Well, that sure <i>is</i> a calamity!”
laughed Jim Tracy. “I’ll have to see to that.
Rosebud must have his sugar.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“If he doesn’t, you know he won’t do his tricks
well,” went on the girl, now smiling broadly.
“Please get some for me, Jim.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I sure will, if I have to rob the breakfast table!
I’ll be back in a minute,” he added to Joe. “You
might wait here.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was perfectly willing to wait. He hoped the
“vision” would return.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Is he a new performer?” asked the girl, nodding
and smiling at Joe, as she walked off with the ring-master.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“Well, no, not exactly, Miss Helen. I’ve made
him an offer—I just had to, after I saw him
doing some stunts on a trapeze—but he seems to
think he likes magic better.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then he doesn’t like our circus?” The girl
stopped, and once more she pouted prettily.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, it isn’t that, I assure you!” exclaimed Joe
quickly. “But you see I am under some obligations
to Professor Rosello, and I don’t want to leave
him in the middle of the season.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s right,” chimed in Jim. “It’s best to play
fair. But come along, Miss Helen, and I’ll see if
I can rustle some sugar for Rosebud.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Good-bye!” she called to Joe. “But I should
think you’d like a circus better than doing those
queer tricks. Though they <i>are</i> nice,” she added,
with a little nod.</p>

<p class='c007'>The sun seemed to have gone under a cloud to
Joe as she went out of the tent. Brightness had
vanished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I almost wish I had taken his offer,” mused
the lad. “I wonder——” he paused as he remembered
the flash of her brown eyes and her smile.
“No, I’d better stick to the professor. Maybe—later——Oh,
well, I’ll have to think about
it.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He walked about, looking at the preparations
still going on to get the main tent in readiness for
the show. He saw Jim coming back, alone.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>“Did you get the sugar?” he asked the ring-master.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. Rosebud won’t starve to-day.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Who’s Rosebud?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Her trick horse, and a dandy, too.” Then,
though Joe did not ask, Jim went on. “She’s one
of our biggest drawing cards. Her name is Helen
Morton, but she’s billed as Mademoiselle Mortonti.
It looks better on paper.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What does she do?” Joe found himself asking.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fancy riding, and on a trick horse. She makes
Rosebud do all sorts of tricks—amuses the young
folks, and some of the old ones too. She makes
a great pet of her horse and gives him lump sugar
as a reward. I generally have a supply on hand
for her, but it must have got side-tracked on account
of the mix-up. However, I found some for
her.</p>

<p class='c007'>“She’s one of the finest little girls in the world,”
went on the ring-master earnestly. “We all love
her. She’s an orphan, but she doesn’t lack friends.
Some folks sort of look down on circus performers,”
went on Jim, with a flash of his eyes, “but I
want to tell you, right now, that——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You don’t need to tell <i>me</i> anything,” said Joe
in a low voice. “My mother was a circus performer.
Madame Hortense was the name she rode
under.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>Jim stared at Joe with open mouth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Your mother in the profesh?” he asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I can’t say I ever heard of her—but
that’s not strange,” said the ring-master slowly.
“I haven’t been in the business all my life. But if
your mother was a circus rider then you know.
Shake!”</p>

<p class='c007'>He held out a powerful hand. Joe gripped it
none the less powerfully.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, you’ve got some hold!” exclaimed the ring-master
with admiration in his voice. “Better think
my offer over.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’d like to,” answered Joe, “but I’d better stick
where I am for the present.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you know best. But if you ever decide
to join—you can always find our advance
route bookings in one of the theatrical papers.
Drop me a line.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe promised to do so, and went outside, perhaps
hoping for a sight of Miss Morton. But he
did not see her. He did, however, see much that
interested him in the way of circus life, and he
understood something of the fascination it had for
his mother, especially as she was such an accomplished
horsewoman; and feats of horsemanship
are nowhere better appreciated than in a circus.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, did you see all you wanted?” asked Benny
Turton, as Joe rejoined him.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>“Yes, I saw lots. Even got an offer to go with
the show.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You didn’t!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes I did,” and Joe narrated his experience.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, I think maybe you’d make out good in a
circus,” said Benny, holding up his scaly suit for
a close examination. He wanted no more leaks
in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I’ll stick to magic for a while yet,” Joe
answered. “But I think you’ll be busy soon, getting
ready for the performance, so I’ll leave
you. Remember, I’m coming to see you do your
stunt.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I hope you do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>As Professor Rosello was not going to give a
show that evening, Joe was free. He went to the
afternoon and evening circus performances, and he
tried to tell himself that it was to watch the
“human fish” and some other special acts. But
though Benny’s act was interesting and startling,
Joe paid more attention to the riding of Miss Helen
Morton and the tricks of her horse, Rosebud,
than he did to Benny. And the performance of
Mademoiselle Mortonti was well worth watching.
It was a beautiful exhibition of horsemanship on
the part of a refined young girl, and it brought
forth round after round of applause, in which Joe
joined enthusiastically.</p>

<p class='c007'>The circus moved out of town after the final
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>performance, and Joe and the professor gave their
show.</p>

<p class='c007'>They did not draw as large crowds as they would
have done had not the counter attraction of the
circus operated against them, but they did fairly
well.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe introduced a new trick, which made an instant
hit. It was very simple, too.</p>

<p class='c007'>When his turn came to occupy the stage he advanced
with a candle and a box of matches in
his hand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fire is a mysterious element,” he stated. “It
is a good servant but a bad master. Well controlled,
fire and light are very useful. Now I
have here a candle which is exceptionally well
educated. That is it can be lighted, extinguished
and lighted again by the mere movement of my
wand.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I don’t say every one can do this, for you
have not all of you magic wands. But, lest some
of you think the trick is easy, I am going to ask
one of you to come up here and light this candle.
Will you come?” and he indicated a young man in
a front seat. After some hesitation the youth ascended
the stage.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you know which end of a match to light?”
asked Joe. The youth grinningly admitted that
he did. Joe then handed him a candle and bade
him light it. When it was aglow Joe handed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>youth the wand, and told him to point it at the
candle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just point it at the flame, and order it to go
out—vamoose!” Joe ordered. The youth tried this,
but the candle still burned on. “I guess you’ll have
to speak louder,” observed Joe with a smile, “the
candle may be deaf.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Accordingly the youth shouted, but still the candle
burned.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Louder!” urged Joe, and the youth fairly yelled.
But still the candle burned brightly. “You see not
every one has the magic power,” stated the young
performer. “Now let me show you how it is done.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Just help this young man down the steps,” Joe
directed his assistant, the boy previously referred
to. “I am afraid he may have strained himself
shouting.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There was a laugh at this, and the audience
watched Joe’s helper solicitously assisting the
volunteer down the steps.</p>

<p class='c007'>While this was going on Joe had taken the lighted
candle and had walked back with it to one of his
tables, on which he placed it.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now I will show you how it is done,” he said.
“Ah, the wind has blown out the candle, but as the
wind can not light it again I will first do so with
a match, and we will then call on the forces of
magic to do the rest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe lighted the candle, and then, standing some
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>little distance from the table on which the glowing
taper stood, he pointed his wand at it, and cried:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Out, candle!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Immediately the candle was extinguished.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I didn’t blow it out.” Joe said, pretending
that some one in the audience had said that.
“To prove it I will, without moving, light it from
where I stand.” Then he exclaimed:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Candle, light!”</p>

<p class='c007'>At once the candle leaped into a glow. There
were surprised exclamations at this, and Joe repeated
the trick several times.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It is very easy when you know how,” he said,
“and to prove there is no trick about it I will pass
the candle down to you for examination.” Joe
tossed a candle among the audience. Several examined
it. There was no doubt that it was just
an ordinary candle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“How did he do it?” every one asked.</p>

<p class='c007'>The secret lay in a trick candle. The first one
Joe lighted for the young man was an ordinary
taper. Once blown out it could not be lighted except
with a match.</p>

<p class='c007'>But when Joe had his helper assist the young
man down off the stage, the young magician took
advantage of the fun and confusion over this to
substitute on his table a trick candle for the ordinary
one.</p>

<p class='c007'>This trick candle consisted of a metal tube,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>painted white, and made to look exactly like a
candle, with a metal point at the top to represent
a wick. Inside the hollow metal tube was a small
wax taper, a miniature candle, and it was held up
near the top by an inside, spiral spring. The spring
was strong enough to carry up the taper as fast as
it burned, but could be pulled down by a black
silk thread, coming out at the bottom of the candle
stick, and extending across the stage through the
draperies, where it was held by Professor Rosello,
who helped Joe in this illusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe quickly substituted the trick candle for the
real one and lighted it, pretending that the wind
had blown that one out as he walked to the table.</p>

<p class='c007'>With the trick candle aglow, Joe only had to take
his position where he pleased, and order the candle
to go out. At once Professor Rosello, behind the
scenes, pulled the black thread, invisible to the audience.
The taper, still lighted, was pulled down
inside the hollow metal candle stick, and, of course,
it seemed just as if it went out. It was still burning,
however, some small air holes on the back of
the tube, where they could not be seen, providing
the oxygen.</p>

<p class='c007'>When Joe, pointing the other end of his wand at
the candle, ordered it to light, Professor Rosello
released the string, and the concealed spring raised
the still lighted taper into view, so that the candle
appeared to light itself in a mysterious manner.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>Thus Joe did the trick, which was received very
well, causing quite a sensation. Professor Rosello
complimented him on its success.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was toward the close of the performance. Joe
was about to step down off the stage to pass
through the audience with a vase for examination,
when he looked to the back of the hall, and there,
to his great surprise, he saw the vindictive face of
his foster-father, Deacon Blackford. Joe gasped,
and quickly turned back. Under pretense of arranging
the trick with the professor, Joe whispered:</p>

<p class='c007'>“My foster-father is out in the audience. He
must have been following me and he has come here
to arrest me. He thinks I stole that money, but
I didn’t. I don’t want to be falsely arrested.
What shall I do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor thought quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It was a narrow escape,” he said. “He almost
caught you. He is probably waiting for you to
come down in the crowd so he can grab you.
Quick now. Go behind the scenes. I’ll hold the
audience with some patter. Then you tell the boy
to come out and help me with this trick. He can
do it as well as you, as it is very simple. I’ll finish
the rest of the show alone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But what shall I do?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Slip out by the stage door, go to the hotel, get
your things and take the first train for Seneca.
We show there next. I’ll come on as soon as I can
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>pack up after the show. We’ll fool the deacon.
There is no need of being arrested if you are innocent,
and it is evident he came here to take you
into custody. It’s a good thing you saw him in
time.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe hurried back of the scenes, while Professor
Rosello held the attention of the audience, including
that of Deacon Blackford.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXII<br> <span class='large'>STRANGE NEWS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Because of what had happened and the trouble
that might be caused to Joe should his foster-father
cause his arrest, Professor Rosello made a
change in the end of his show. He substituted
some simple tricks for the more elaborate feats
of magic in which he needed Joe’s help.</p>

<p class='c007'>Still he kept the audience amused, and that was
the main point. Professor Rosello even saw Deacon
Blackford laughing at some of the tricks and
the “patter” which accompanied them. But immediately
after he smiled, the stern man became
more stern, as though ashamed of himself for having
given way to mirth.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I guess he’ll find out, if he lives long enough,”
thought the performer, “that circus people and magicians
aren’t as black as they are painted.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor was thoroughly impressed with
the belief in Joe’s innocence, and he did not want
to see him subjected to the humiliation of an arrest.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Innocent as he is, and as I believe him to be,”
thought the professor, “it would take time to prove
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>it, and it would delay my show. It may make him
look guilty to run away in this fashion, but I believe
it the best way. Later on, if necessary, Joe
can give himself up and explain.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Meanwhile Joe, having the same idea, was making
his way out of the stage door of the theatre.
He hurried to the hotel, packed up his belongings
and took a train to the next town. The professor
and the baggage would come by a later train.</p>

<p class='c007'>“That was a narrow escape,” mused Joe, as he
hurried away. “I wonder how he found me?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The answer to that question was not difficult.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Rosello went on with the performance.
Among other tricks was the one of making the
arithmetic sum appear on the slate—the trick Joe
had explained to his chums the day the fireworks
factory burned.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another was the producing of hundreds of feet
of colored paper, in the shape of a ribbon, and
scores of paper flowers from a hat borrowed from
some one in the audience. The hat was shown
empty, and immediately thereafter the performer,
putting in the end of his wand, proceeded to wind
out on it yard after yard of paper ribbon. Next he
shook out paper flowers, so that with the ribbon,
they made quite a pile on the table—a pile much
larger than the hat itself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I didn’t know you carried all that stuff with
you, sir,” said the professor to the man whose hat
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>he had borrowed. “You must find it quite a burden.</p>

<p class='c007'>“And that isn’t all, either,” went on the performer.
He looked closely into the hat, a puzzled
look came over his face, and he asked: “Have
you a permit to carry live stock about with you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Live stock?” repeated the man, wonderingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes. I see something alive in here. Here it
is,” and, putting in his hand, which was seen to be
empty, while the other grasped the hat by the brim,
the professor pulled out a live and kicking guinea
pig.</p>

<p class='c007'>The audience laughed heartily at this, and the
professor tried to put back into the hat the heap
of paper ribbon, flowers and the live animal. Of
course, they would not fit.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well,” went on the performer, with a puzzled
air, “<i>you</i> may be able to get all those things in your
hat, my dear sir, but <i>I</i> can’t, though I was able
to get them out.”</p>

<p class='c007'>He then piled the paper ribbon and flowers on
the head covering and passed it to the man. The
guinea pig was taken in charge by the young assistant
to be used on the next occasion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It need hardly be explained that Professor
Rosello put all the articles in the hat (“loaded”
it, to use the magician’s term) as he walked back
with it from where he had borrowed it to the
stage. The guinea pig, which had been used so
often in the trick that it was very tame, and would
<span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>lie quietly where placed, was first put in the bottom
of the hat while it was held close to the lower
part of the performer’s vest. He had the little
animal under there, putting it in its hiding place
just before he was ready to work the trick.</p>

<p class='c007'>The paper ribbon and flowers he had concealed in
a secret pocket, and these he slipped into the hat
with the pig on his way up the stage steps. He
was now ready for the trick.</p>

<p class='c007'>Paper ribbon for this purpose comes wound in
tight rolls, and can be bought in any conjuring-goods
store. It rolls up into a very compact mass,
but when unwound, and fluffed up, occupies much
greater space, so that what seems to be a bushel or
more can be taken from an ordinary derby.</p>

<p class='c007'>The paper flowers are in the same class. They
come in compact form, in bundles. A bundle, which
can easily be palmed, is dropped into the hat. A
pressure of the thumb breaks the binding, and the
tiny wire springs in the petals of the flowers cause
them to expand, thus occupying a much larger space
than before, so that the hat seems to be overflowing
with them. Under the paper ribbon and the flowers
was the guinea pig. The outside wrapping of the
compact bundles of ribbon and flowers is made
black, so that it is not seen against the dark background
of the hat’s interior.</p>

<p class='c007'>And it might be stated here that no matter
what trick of this character is done by a magician,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>it may be set down as a safe rule that nothing
ever comes out of a hat, a vase, a box or anything
else, unless it has first gone in. So if a magician
takes a live pig out of a hat, it is very certain he
first put it there. Of course, how he gets it there
is his trick—he does it so quickly and deftly that
one fails to see him. Certainly, one cannot fold a
guinea pig up into a packet the size of a pill box,
as one can yards and yards of paper ribbon, but
there are ways of getting it in a hat which differ
with each conjurer.</p>

<p class='c007'>The show was over, the audience departed, having
passed an enjoyable evening, and Professor
Rosello was putting away his apparatus when he
saw a man walking down the aisle toward the stage.
He suspected this was Joe’s foster-father and the
suspicion was made a certainty a moment later.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You had a young man working for you on
the stage, didn’t you?” asked the deacon. “He
was here a while ago.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I have an assistant. Here, boy!” Professor
Rosello called.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I don’t mean that one,” said the deacon, as
the small lad came out. “I mean the other. Joe
Strong his name is.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, Joe. Yes,” said the professor slowly.
“Well, he’s gone.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gone?” The deacon looked startled. “I was
waiting for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>“Well, he’s gone,” went on the professor. “He’s
far away from here now. Perhaps if he had
known you wanted him he would have waited.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, no, he wouldn’t!” exclaimed the deacon.
“He knew what I wanted all right—that is if he
saw me, which I didn’t think he did. I want him
on a charge of robbery. He also set fire to my
place, though I don’t say he did that on purpose.
However, he’s got to pay for the damage. But
where is he? I’ve got a warrant for him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“He’s gone, I tell you,” insisted the professor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll find him,” stormed the old man. “I
traced him here and I’ll trace him farther. One
of the boys from our town saw him a few weeks
ago, and Joe sent a message to me, saying he
didn’t take the money. But I know he did. I made
up my mind I’d get him, and I heard your show
was coming here. So I came here to wait for
Joe. He may have run away again, but I’ll get him.
I’ll have him locked up for robbing me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, you’ll have to settle that with him,” observed
the professor, coolly. “I know nothing
about it, except that I believe Joe is innocent.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I don’t!” exclaimed the deacon. “And I’ll
get him yet! You tell him that for me!” and he
shook his fist as he went out of the now dark
theatre.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I think he means trouble,” mused the professor,
as he prepared to take the train.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>As arranged, Joe and the professor met later
that night in the town where they were next to
show. Professor Rosello told of his interview with
the deacon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“He surely is after you, Joe,” he added.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I’ll have to be on the lookout; that’s all,”
decided the boy wizard. “I’m not going to be
punished for something I didn’t do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Three days after this, having arrived at a large
town where they were to remain two nights, Professor
Rosello came to the theatre in the afternoon
to see if Joe had everything in readiness for
the evening’s show.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Joe,” remarked the magician, as he noted that
his young helper had left nothing undone, “Joe,
did your foster-father ever have any business dealings
with two men whose first names were Burke
and Jake?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Burke and Jake,” repeated Joe, thoughtfully.
“I don’t know that he did. You see he was in the
feed business, and lots of men came to sell to him,
or buy. I wouldn’t know half of them, though I
often helped about the store. Why do you ask that,
Professor?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it’s a strange sort of thing, and there
may be nothing in it,” went on the professor.
“But I was just down at the hotel, having a bit of
lunch, and at the table next to mine were two
men. They called each other Burke and Jake,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>and in the course of their talk they mentioned
Deacon Blackford’s name several times.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“They did?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, and not only that, but they knew about
the theft of the money from him and Mrs. Blackford.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I suppose the deacon has pretty well advertised
the loss,” said Joe, “so there isn’t anything
so strange in that.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, perhaps not,” admitted the professor,
slowly. “But here is the strange part of it, Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Those two men—I didn’t catch their last
names—not only seemed to know about the loss,
but they laughed over it as though it were a good
joke. In fact, I should say, just from a casual
observation and from what I heard, that they
knew more about the theft than even the deacon
himself.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You think they do?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s my impression.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Maybe they were detectives,” Joe suggested.
“The deacon would call in the police, and they
might be on my trail. I wonder if I had better
get out while I have the chance?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t do that,” said the professor. “These
men weren’t detectives, I’m sure of that. But they
certainly laughed about the deacon’s loss in a knowing
way.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder who they are,” mused Joe.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIII<br> <span class='large'>“I’VE GOT YOU!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Joe had been reading a letter when Professor
Rosello came in with the strange news about the
two men. The letter was from Benny Turton,
the “human fish,” of Sampson Brothers’ Circus, and
was in response to a souvenir postcard Joe had sent
the lad, hardly expecting a reply. Joe had just
done it as a kind remembrance to the lad to whom
he had given a little help.</p>

<p class='c007'>But Benny wrote rather a long letter in reply,
Joe having given his future address. In the letter
Benny said that he was not feeling well, but that
he still had to go on with his tank act.</p>
<p class='c006'>“I rather wish, some days, that I had your work,”
he wrote. “I gave your regards, as you requested,
to Jim Tracy and Miss Morton. They wish to be
remembered to you. Miss Morton wants to know
if you are ever going to join a circus.”</p>

<p class='c006'>Joe smiled in reflective fashion as he folded the
letter and put it in his pocket. So Helen Morton,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>“Mademoiselle Mortonti,” had not forgotten him,
nor had the ring-master, though their acquaintanceship
was of the briefest. Joe was glad they had
remembered him—particularly glad in the case of
Helen.</p>

<p class='c007'>But, for the time being, the letter was put aside.
Joe’s mind was busy trying to conjecture who the
two men at the hotel could be.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wonder if I’d better go down and see if I
can’t get a look at them without their seeing me?”
he asked Professor Rosello.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I wouldn’t, Joe,” was the advice. “If I’m any
judge they’ll be at the show to-night, and you can
see them then.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What makes you think they’ll be here?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I heard one of them ask what sort of
show ours was. There are posters in the hotel
you know. The other man said it wasn’t half
bad—quite a compliment to us, Joe. And the
first one remarked, as they had nothing to do to-night,
they might as well take in our performance.
So we may see them in the audience.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Do you think they know I’m with you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t see how they can. You don’t recall
them, and it isn’t likely they’d know you.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“All right, then I’ll be on the lookout for them,”
Joe decided. “It sure is queer, though, that they
should make a joke about the deacon’s loss.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“That’s the way it struck me,” agreed the professor.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>“Now how about the tricks to-night? Have
you the pigeons and the canary?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes,” answered Joe. “But I’m not just sure
of what I am to do.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then we’ll have a little rehearsal.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe was a little nervous that evening as the
time for the performance drew near and the theatre
began to fill. He was not at all alarmed at
the part he was to play on the stage, for he had
become used to that now. But he wanted to see
the strange men, to ascertain if, by any possible
chance, they could be some of the customers of his
foster-father—customers he might have seen about
the feed and grain place.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll point them out to you if I see them,” said
the professor, as he was getting into his dress suit—the
suit that had about it so many pockets, hidden
in various places, so that articles could be gotten
rid of or produced at will. Joe now had a suit like
this, since he did almost as many tricks as Professor
Rosello himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I may not be able to see them very well from
the stage,” Joe remarked.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well then, you can invent some excuse to go
down in the audience. Work one of the simple
card tricks, or something like that.” For Joe was
becoming adept in manipulating cards, allowing
persons to choose cards, thrust them back into the
pack without his seeing them, and picking them
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>out again. Of course, this was all done either by
“forcing” certain cards, known in advance, or by
clever cutting, shuffling the cards falsely, or by
prepared trick cards.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, that might do,” agreed Joe. “We’ll just
have to trust to luck.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The curtain went up, and the usual procedure
was gone through with. Joe noticed that the professor
was paying more attention than usual to the
audience, carefully scrutinizing every section of the
hall. But if he saw the two suspicious men he
gave no sign to Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>There were two new tricks to be performed that
evening. One was the production of two doves in
a seemingly empty cage, causing them to materialize
from guinea pigs.</p>

<p class='c007'>Another illusion was to seemingly burn up a
canary bird, and bring it to life again.</p>

<p class='c007'>The first trick went off well. A large bird cage
was shown on a table. There was nothing in it,
as far as could be seen. Professor Rosello took
two small, live guinea pigs, which he said he would
put into a tin cylinder on a second table, and at the
firing of a pistol the guinea pigs would disappear,
being changed into doves in the empty
cage.</p>

<p class='c007'>He did just as he said he would do. The guinea
pigs were put in the tin cylinder and the cover
clapped on. The performer aimed a stage pistol
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>at the tin, fired, and with the flash and report
two white doves were seen fluttering in the cage.
The tin cylinder, being opened, was seen to be
empty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trick was mechanical, of course. As soon as
the guinea pigs were put in the cylinder, they
slipped down through a false bottom, and
through a trap in the table, to a little box
made to receive them. That left the cylinder
empty.</p>

<p class='c007'>The bird cage was a trick one. As the audience
looked at it while it stood on the table, it seemed
to be an ordinary cage. But behind it was a black
velvet curtain which concealed from view the fact
that the back of the cage was double. It was
as if the bottom of the cage had been folded
up against the rear, and in between the false bottom
and the back, was a place large enough to
hold two white doves.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the pistol was fired Joe, behind the scenes,
pulled a black silk thread that let the false side
fall down, and become a second bottom of the
cage. The falling away of the side allowed the
doves to flutter from their concealed hiding place
into the cage, where they seemed to appear so
miraculously.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trick with the canary was worked differently.
A live canary, was shown. It was placed in a light
paper bag, the mouth tied, and the bag and canary
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>were hung in the center of a target suspended on
the stage by wires. After the usual “patter” a
rifle was fired at the suspended bag. To make the
trick more effective some one in the audience was
allowed to shoot at the canary in the bag. As he
did so the bag burst into flames, disappeared and,
where the target had been, there suddenly appeared
a bird cage with a live canary in it.</p>

<p class='c007'>The trick was worked as follows:</p>

<p class='c007'>Two canaries were used. Before the trick was
performed one was put into a trick cage which,
when suspended from the stage with its top toward
the audience, seemed to be a target. There was
a paper target and bull’s-eye in fact, but it closed
up by springs at the proper time, and did not show
on top of the cage, which contained a live canary
in a secret compartment.</p>

<p class='c007'>This piece of apparatus was in place before the
trick started. The professor put a live canary in a
paper bag. That is, he seemed to do so. In reality
the canary was safely hidden in a compartment of
a table near which the professor stood with the bag.
This was sleight-of-hand work. The bag was made
of a special kind of paper which would burn instantly,
with a flash of fire when ignited, something
like flash-light powder.</p>

<p class='c007'>Professor Rosello appeared to hang the paper
bag, inside of which was the canary, in front of
the bull’s-eye. As a matter of fact, there was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>nothing in the paper bag. But it was hung near a
little electrical device, from which ran wires back
of the rear stage draperies. Behind the curtains
Joe was concealed.</p>

<p class='c007'>When all was ready the professor handed some
one in the audience a stage gun that fired no
missile—only making a report. The man was told
to aim at the paper bag in front of the target, and
did so.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Fire!” called the professor, after some talk in
which he professed uneasiness for the safety of the
audience.</p>

<p class='c007'>At the sound of the report the paper bag disappeared
in a flash of flame and smoke. The target
also disappeared, and there, hanging from its supporting
wires, was a bird cage with a live canary in
it.</p>

<p class='c007'>When the gun was fired Joe, behind the scenes,
pressed the button of the electrical device. A tiny
flame appeared, set fire to the prepared bag, which
at once went up in smoke. At the same time Joe
pulled a black silk thread connected with the birdcage
which, with its top presented to the audience,
looked like a target. The target was folded away
out of sight, and the bird cage, which was a collapsible
one, expanded to its regular shape, the
second canary fluttering about as soon as released
from the secret compartment where it had been
hidden all the while.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>Thus was a bird seemingly burned, only to be
reincarnated. It was an effective illusion.</p>

<p class='c007'>It was now time for Joe’s disappearing trick,
and while he was taking his place on the prepared
chair over the trap-door in the stage, and while
the professor was putting the black sheet over him,
he managed to whisper to Joe:</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look at the two men in the seventh row in the
two end seats on your right.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I see them,” said Joe in a low voice.</p>

<p class='c007'>“They are the ones I heard talking at the hotel.
Do you know them?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The professor asked this in between his “patter”
which went with the disappearing trick.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Their faces seem familiar,” Joe said, as the veil
went over his head. “But I’m not sure I know
them. I’ll see them after the show.”</p>

<p class='c007'>There were a few more illusions, and the performance
came to a close. Joe, not stopping to
change his clothes, started down the aisle.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I’ll follow those men,” he said to the professor,
who nodded a permission.</p>

<p class='c007'>But as Joe reached the lobby of the theatre,
intending to question the men, if he could stop
them, he fell back in astonishment at the sight
of his foster-father and Hen Sylvester, one of the
Bedford constables.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Ha! There he is!” cried the deacon. “I’ve
got you now!” and he made a grab for Joe.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXIV<br> <span class='large'>CAUGHT</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Joe did not know what to do. He could not
very well run away through that crowd. To do
so would be such a confession of guilt that almost
any officer would arrest him. And Hen Sylvester
certainly would take after him, creating a scene.</p>

<p class='c007'>On the other hand, if Joe was delayed the men
would get away. And he wanted to know more
about them. He looked hurriedly around but did
not see them. The deacon misinterpreted this look,
for he cried in angry tones.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look out for him, Hen! He’s trying to escape.
Grab him!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, I’ll grab him all right!” cried the constable.
“He got away from me once, on the freight, but
he won’t now.”</p>

<p class='c007'>The officer made a grab for Joe and an excited
crowd gathered about. Joe made up his mind
quickly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here, Dad,” he said, giving his foster-parent
the name he often used. “Don’t make a scene
here. There’s no use using violence. I’ll go with
you quietly. You’re making a big mistake, for I can
explain everything.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“You can’t explain away about my——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Hush,” cautioned Hen. For he liked Joe, and
did not want it published to the crowd that the
lad was suspected of theft.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Gentlemen, will you come with me?” interrupted
Professor Rosello, who had followed Joe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>to the lobby. “Come to my dressing room, where
we can talk matters over quietly,” he went on.
“It’s all right,” he said to the crowd and to the
theatrical employees who had gathered about.
“Just a mistake, that’s all. This way, gentlemen.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“But those men!” exclaimed Joe. “They’ll get
away!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll have to take chances on that,” the professor
whispered to him. “Maybe they’ll stay at
the hotel all night. But you must take the deacon
and the officer out of this. We’ll talk to them
in my room.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe saw the wisdom of this, and a little later he
was facing the angry dealer and the constable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Now then,” began the professor, “what’s it all
about?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It’s about this boy,” said the deacon, sternly.
“He robbed me of considerable money. He robbed
my wife, too, and set fire to the place, but I put
it out. That’s what the matter is!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I have a warrant for his arrest,” went
on Hen Sylvester. “He is charged with robbery.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I never took a cent of yours, nor Mrs. Blackford’s
either!” cried Joe, “and I don’t know anything
about a fire. I did run away from your
house, because I could stand it no longer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then, in  impassioned tones, he told the story of
that eventful night—how he had caught the freight
and met the professor. He spoke briefly of his
work as a magician.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What makes you think he robbed you?” asked
the magician of the deacon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Why, I saw him leaving by the window, and
right after that I missed the papers and the money.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Did you see Joe’s face?”</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>“No. But I know it was him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It wasn’t,” said Joe. “I never stole in my life.
Listen, Deacon Blackford. You were robbed—of
that there’s no doubt—but it was by some one else.
When you stopped me just now, I was on the trail
of some men who undoubtedly know something
about the crime.”</p>

<p class='c007'>Rapidly, earnestly, Joe told about the two men—the
men who had joked about the deacon’s loss,
the men he had tried to follow from the theatre.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Their names were Burke and Jake,” he said.
“Do you know who they were?” and he turned
to his foster-father.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Burke and Jake! Burke Denton and Jake Harrison!”
murmured the deacon. “I—I never thought
of them! The papers—the investment papers—they
were taken with the money—why—why——”</p>

<p class='c007'>He seemed lost in thought for a moment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Look here!” he finally said. “I’m not saying
you didn’t rob me, Joe, but I’m a Christian, and
I don’t want to accuse anybody unjustly. It is true
that the men you speak of might have done it.
Where can they be found?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I don’t know—now,” answered Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>Joe pleaded his case earnestly. He went over
every detail of his escape from the deacon’s house
that night, and described every movement so minutely
that an unprejudiced listener could not help
believing him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You and Jim chased me,” he said to Hem Sylvester.
“I didn’t want to stop for fear of missing
the train. I suppose that did look sort of guilty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“It sure did,” agreed Hen.</p>

<p class='c007'>“But you know what time the train left. You
saw me jump in the box car,” went on Joe. “And
you,” turning to the deacon, “know what time it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>was when you saw some one getting out of the
window. Now could I have gotten from the house
to the train in that difference of time?”</p>

<p class='c007'>The deacon and the constable thought a moment.
The deacon mentioned the time he had seen the
robber escaping, and it was evident that Joe could
not have been in two places at once.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I guess that practically clears you,” admitted
Sylvester. “I don’t see as we have any
use for this warrant, Deacon,” and he produced the
paper.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Save it,” said Joe with a smile. “Maybe you
can change the names and use it on those two men.
We’ll see if we can catch them. What kind of
investment papers did they take from you?” he
asked the deacon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Some like this,” and the deacon produced a
bond. “It’s the only one they overlooked.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“May I borrow it?” asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'>The deacon let him take it, and then all four of
them left the theatre, it not being necessary to
take away any of the “props,” as another performance
was to be given the next night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“We’ll go to the hotel,” suggested Joe. “It’s
just possible the men may be there. They haven’t
anything to suspect unless they saw you,” he said
to the deacon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No, I don’t believe they saw us,” said Hen.
“We didn’t get here until after dark. The deacon
read in the paper that your show was here, so he
got me, and we took the late afternoon train from
Bedford.”</p>

<p class='c007'>A glance in the hotel lobby did not disclose the
two men, but in the cafe they were seen sitting at
a table. A look through the swinging doors showed
this.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>“Have you authority to make arrests here?”
asked Joe of the constable.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, this is in the same county as Bedford.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then go in and arrest those two men. I’m
sure they’re guilty.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“And I am too,” said the deacon. “Take ’em
in, Hen. I’ll swear out a warrant against ’em!”</p>

<p class='c007'>That was all the constable needed. He had authority
for his act now. He marched into the
cafe, the deacon, Joe and the professor fallowing.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I arrest you in the name of the law!” exclaimed
Sylvester, laying a hand each on the two men’s
shoulders. “You’re caught and you’ve got to come
with me!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Denton and Harrison started up, but at the sight
of the deacon sank back in their chairs. Before
they could move the constable had snapped handcuffs
on them.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <h2 class='c005'>CHAPTER XXV<br> <span class='large'>JOE’S CLEVER TRICK</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>“What’s the joke?” demanded Jake Harrison,
with a sort of sneer as he looked at the handcuffs
on his wrists. “If this is one of your conjuring
tricks, you’ve come to the wrong shop,” and he
glared at the professor.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It isn’t any trick,” put in Joe, “except that we’ve
turned a trick against you. You’re both under
arrest.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“There! What did I tell you!” whined Burke
Denton. “I said if we——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Stop your noise!” savagely ordered his companion.
“Now then, what does all this mean?”
he went on. “What right have you to arrest us?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“The right of the law,” put in Sylvester, who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>seemed to enjoy the role he was playing. “I’m
constable all over Folsom county, and you’re my
prisoners!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“On what charge?” demanded Harrison. “You
keep still!” he directed his companion as he saw
Denton about to speak. “I’ll run this end of the
show. What’s the charge against us?” he asked
fiercely.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Robbing me and my wife of money—about one
hundred and forty dollars,” said the deacon.</p>

<p class='c007'>“What proof have you?” asked Harrison, sneeringly.
“Did you see us take the money?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“I saw one of you getting out of the window
after the money was gone,” went on the deacon.
This was practically admitting that Joe was not
guilty.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Which one of us did you see?” asked Harrison.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—er—I er——” the deacon hesitated. He could
not positively state which of the twain it was. He
had seen no face, and the room was not well
lighted.</p>

<p class='c007'>“It wasn’t only money that was taken, was it,
Deacon?” asked Joe, for he was now ready to take
a hand in the proceedings.</p>

<p class='c007'>“No. It was securities—papers that you two
alone knew the value of,” said the deacon, quickly.
“You took the investment papers, Denton and Harrison,
I’m sure you did!”</p>

<p class='c007'>Harrison laughed.</p>

<p class='c007'>“You’ll have to have some better proof than just
being sure we did it,” he said. “That won’t go in
law. Now you’d better take these ornaments off
us, and let us go,” he ordered Hen Sylvester. “You
haven’t a single bit of evidence against us, and if
you persist in arresting us we’ll sue for false imprisonment.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>You haven’t a bit of evidence!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Haven’t we? What’s this?” cried Joe Strong,
suddenly.</p>

<p class='c007'>With a quick motion, he drew from an inner
pocket of Burke Denton’s coat a folded bond paper.
At the sight of it Denton’s jaw dropped, and even
Harrison’s eyes opened wide in astonishment.</p>

<p class='c007'>“There’s one of the stolen securities now in
your possession,” said Joe calmly. “Isn’t that evidence
enough?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How—how did that get in my pocket?” asked
Denton. “I thought you had ’em all, Harrison. I
told you not to be so careless with ’em, and now——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Keep still, can’t you!” fairly yelled the other.
“Do you want to put us in——”</p>

<p class='c007'>Then he himself stopped, as if conscious that he
was saying too much.</p>

<p class='c007'>Denton had collapsed in his chair. Harrison,
also, seemed to have wilted. There was now practically
no doubt of the men’s guilt. Hen Sylvester
locked them up in the local jail until such time as
he could arrange to transfer them to Bedford.
Neither of the prisoners protested any further.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Say, Joe, how did you know that investment
bond was in his pocket?” asked the constable a
little later.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Because I put it there,” was the reply. “It
was the one I took from the deacon. I thought I
might have a use for it. It was just a little sleight-of-hand
work, making it seem as if it came from
his pocket.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, it—it was a good trick,” grudgingly admitted
Mr. Blackford.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then you don’t think I’m guilty; do you?”
asked Joe.</p>

<p class='c007'><span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>The deacon shook his head. He seemed quite
ashamed of himself.</p>

<p class='c007'>“If I was you, Deacon,” said Hen, in a whisper
to the old man, “I’d sort of beg Joe’s pardon for
suspecting him. You know he could make it hot
for you if he wanted to.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“How?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Sue you for false arrest, for humiliating him in
a crowd, and all that. You’d better conciliate him.”</p>

<p class='c007'>This the deacon did, not altogether willingly.</p>

<p class='c007'>“I—I’m sorry I tried to have you arrested, Joe,”
he said. “I admit I was wrong in thinking you
robbed me.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, that’s all right,” said Joe, easily. He could
afford to forgive now. “It did look a bit suspicious
against me for a while. But I’m glad you have
the right men. I don’t want to be in fear of arrest
as I travel about with the professor. And I don’t
suppose you want to take me home, do you?”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, no, perhaps not, under the circumstances,”
replied the deacon, slowly. “I admit that maybe
I wasn’t altogether right in the way I treated you,
Joe. But I meant it for the best. You can stay
with the professor, if you like. You seem to be
doing well.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Indeed he is!” exclaimed Mr. Crabb. “He’s a
wonder!”</p>

<p class='c007'>“Then stay,” the deacon said. The truth was
he felt he would be made fun of if he brought
Joe back, after having stated as publicly as he had
in Bedford that he believed his foster-son guilty
of the robbery. Besides, the deacon had to admit
that Joe was doing better away from him than
with him.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Yes, I guess you’d better stay and be one of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>them trick performers, though I don’t think much
of——”</p>

<p class='c007'>There is little more to tell of this story. The
next morning the deacon and Hen Sylvester went
back to Bedford, taking the two prisoners with
them. Eventually the rascals were convicted of the
crime and sent to jail. The deacon recovered his
valuable papers, but not the money. That had been
spent.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Well, I suppose you will avail yourself of your
foster-father’s permission and remain with me,
won’t you?” asked Professor Rosello, at the conclusion
of the next night’s performance, when they
were getting ready to move on to the next town.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh, yes, I’ll stay for a while,” said Joe. “I
still have much to learn.” But, as he said this, he
saw in fancy a certain pretty face, and he beheld
a girl riding about a circus ring on a beautiful
horse. Joe thought of Helen Morton, of Benny
Turton, the “human fish,” and of the kind ring-master.
Joe was beginning to feel a new and
strange pull at his heart strings.</p>

<p class='c007'>And how it resulted may be learned by reading
the next volume of this series, to be entitled: “Joe
Strong on the Trapeze; or, The Daring Feats of
a Young Circus Performer.”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What are you thinking of, Joe?” asked the professor
as they sat in the train that night.</p>

<p class='c007'>“A new trick,” was the answer. “You take a
horse named Rosebud and you——”</p>

<p class='c007'>“What! A horse on the stage?” cried the professor,
in wonder.</p>

<p class='c007'>“Oh—er—I—I was thinking of something else,”
murmured Joe. And so for a while we will take
leave of Joe Strong.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
